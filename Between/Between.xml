                <p xml:id="p-8">The Second half of the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and the
                    entire 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century was a momentous period of
                    European history and an era which wrought fundamental changes to the social,
                    political, economic and cultural life of what was ultimately to become the
                    Republic of Slovenia, together with the adjacent territories inhabited by ethnic
                    Slovenes. New borders also cut swathes through the lands these people populated.
                    In the aftermath of its 1866 defeat in the War against Italy, Austria ceded
                    Venetia to Italy, thus causing ethnic Slovenes in Slavia Veneta (Beneška
                    Slovenija) to become Italian citizens. A year later, as a consequence of
                    constitutional changes, the Habsburg Empire was transformed into Austria-Hungary
                    Monarchy. In the new dualist state, Slovenes living in Prekmurje and the Porabje
                    were now governed by Hungary, while the majority of the nation remained Austrian
                    subjects. Austria, Hungary and Italy thus came to provide the historical
                    framework for the disparate social, political, economic and cultural development
                    of contemporary ethnic Slovenes living in Central Europe. This period was
                    characterized by the instigation of parliamentary democracy, entrepreneurial
                    incentive, cultural exchange and ethnic friction between Slovenes and the
                    neighbouring nations.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-9">Rising national consciousness and tendencies towards Slovenian
                    emancipation within the Empire (expressed through the United Slovenia political
                    program formulated during the 1848 Spring of Nations) were frustrated by the
                    seemingly unsurmountable obstacle of the nation’s administrative division into
                    disparate historical lands. It was only in Carniola that ethnic Slovenes formed
                    a majority, but even there the fundamental demand of the establishment of a
                    university which would introduce Slovene as a language of instruction across all
                    levels of education was denied.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-10">The Great War, during which Slovenian soldiers fought on all the
                    major fronts (and on the Soča/Isonzo Front, ethnic Slovenes had fought on both
                    the Austrian and Italian sides), brought to the "change of the World". Nearly
                    six centuries of <persName ref="#pers-Habsburg-dynasty">Habsburg</persName> rule
                    were at an end. Slovenes first united with Croats and Serbs from the erstwhile
                    empire in the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (State of SHS). Constituted on
                    29 October 1918, this entity encompassed nearly all those <pb n="6"/> territories<note
                        place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="*">With the exception of Prekmurje,
                        Medjimurje, Bačka, Baranja and the Banat.</note> of the former
                    Austria-Hungary, which were inhabited by south Slavs. On 1 December 1918, the
                    SHS united with the Kingdom of Serbia to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and
                    Slovenes (Kingdom of SHS). Those Slovenes who remained outside this new state
                    (which in 1929 was renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia), embarked on different
                    paths and, consequently, developed dissimilarly.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-11">As a consequence of the 1915 Memorandum of London between the
                    Entente and Italy, thence the 1920 Treaty of Rapallo, some one-third of Slovene
                    ethnic territory, in the west and Littoral areas, came under Italian rule; many
                    Slovenes living in Carinthia also found themselves living in the new Republic of
                    Austria. These minorities were briskly exposed to cultural assimilation,
                    followed by Fascism in Italy (from 1922) and Nazism in Austria (after the 1938
                    Anschluss); likewise, Hungary displayed but little understanding the culture of
                    their ethnic Slovene population. Slovenes living in the centralised state that
                    became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia were essentially in a much better position,
                    despite constant unitarian pressure, this with the aim of creating a unified
                    "Yugoslav" nation.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-12">Compared to the preceding <persName ref="#pers-Habsburg-dynasty"
                        >Habsburg</persName> era, Slovenes in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia enjoyed
                    considerable progress in the context of a burgeoning capitalist economy; culture
                    and science also progressed. The University of Ljubljana (established in 1919)
                    together with the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (established in 1938)
                    played an important role. Slovenes, furthermore, at times contributed
                    importantly to the shaping of Yugoslav politics. The classical multi-party
                    parliamentary system which had developed during the 1920s, came to an end in
                    1929 with the suspension of the constitution and the introduction of
                    dictatorship, nominally headed by the Yugoslav King. During the second half of
                    the 1930s two pan-Yugoslav political organizations were active in the country;
                    the domestic political environment, however, flourished, as did the economy.
                    Indeed, industry and manufacturing developed most extensively across Slovenian
                    territory, and manufactures found ready markets across the rest of Yugoslavia.
                    All of this was instrumental in strengthening national self-confidence amongst
                    the Slovenes.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-13">But the World had been shaked once again by the war. The outbreak
                    of the Second World War in 1939 immediately sucked in ethnic Slovenes living in
                    Italy and Anschluss Austria, and the Yugoslav Slovenes in 1941. The Axis
                    invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1941 marked the onset of a crucial
                    struggle for the very survival and emancipation of the Slovene nation; its whole
                    territory was rapidly occupied – namely by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and
                    Horthy's Hungary – and thence annexed and dismembered.<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn2" n="**">In Europe, only Greece had a similar fate.</note>
                    Within the totalitarian and racist new <pb n="7"/> order created by the Axis powers there
                    was obviously no room for Slovenes as either a national or political subject.
                    Through the expansion of their borders, all three Axis occupiers intended the
                    long-term eradication of Slovenian nation as an ethnic entity, and although
                    their timeframe, methods and strategies in achieving this goal differed,
                    Slovenian historiography applies the term ethnocide to describe the fate
                    intended for ethnic Slovenes.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-14">The reaction of the part of the Slovenes, who did not accept the
                    existing conditions, resulted in the organised armed resistance against the
                    occupation, which was led by the Liberation Front, the main anti-fascist
                    Slovenian resistance political organization, and its military arm Slovenian
                    Partisans. Established at the encouragement of the communists and eventually
                    dominated by them, the armed resistance was opposed by the other part of
                    Slovenes and their political parties and organizations who opted to tie their
                    fate to that of the Axis powers; and who found justification for their military
                    and political collaboration in their fight against godless communism and thus
                    marked the fratricidal struggle during the occupation of Slovenia between 1941
                    and 1945. By means of the victorious resistance movement, which was part of the
                    Yugoslav resistance and renowned by the antifascist coalition, the Slovenes
                    became part of those nations that chased away the fascist dark in 1945.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-15">In its plans for post-war period, Yugoslavia’s victorious
                    communists abolished the pre-war monarchy with its centralist system of
                    government and instead established a federal socialist state, the constituent
                    national republics of which enjoyed a degree of autonomy and self-determination.
                    The ordinance declaring the Federation of Yugoslavia was adopted by the
                    Anti-fascist council in the Bosnian town of Jajce in November 1943. This
                    manifesto gave Slovenes, as well as all the other Yugoslav nations, some
                    important attributes of statehood; indeed, within this emergent entity and its
                    latter incarnations<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="***">Democratic Federal
                        Yugoslavia (in 1945); the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia (in 1946);
                        and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1963–1992).</note>
                    Slovenes had their own federal nation within Yugoslavia. Consequent to the Axis
                    defeat, and thence under the terms of the 1947 Paris Peace Treaty, the Slovenian
                    Littoral – annexed to Italy from 1920 – was ceded to Yugoslavia. The new
                    Socialist Federal Republic was henceforth home to more than ninety per cent of
                    Europe’s ethnic Slovenes, and its importance increased as a consequence. The
                    Second World War, and the struggle against Axis occupation, laid the political
                    foundations and precipitated a series of events that led the Slovene people
                    along a path towards national emancipation, which ultimately culminated in
                    Slovenia’s independence in 1991.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-16">Within the more liberal post-WWII order, ethnic Slovene minorities
                    living in Italy and Austria received the official status of a national minority,
                    but such was <pb n="8"/> met with disparate levels of understanding as to the actual
                    recognition of their needs and rights. Indeed, the Slovene minority in western
                    Hungary were unable to develop their national aspirations to an significant
                    extent.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-17">Post-WWII Yugoslavia was characterized by a one-party communist
                    political system and a socialist economy, within which Slovenes were notable
                    political players in the state’s economic and social development; they also
                    became active in the further definition of their national and cultural identity.
                    Following 1980 death of <persName ref="#pers-BrozJosipTito">Josip Broz
                        Tito</persName>, the leader of the post-war Yugoslav state, Yugoslavia began
                    to sink into a deepening internal crisis. Insurmountable differences in the
                    political and economic outlook of its constituent republics, as well as
                    nationalistic antagonism thwarted headway. The 1980s saw the development of
                    independence ambitions amongst Slovenes culminating in the decade’s end decision
                    to split with Yugoslavia and, with that, build an ideologically different
                    society with a pluralist parliamentary democracy and market economy. In 1991 the
                    Republic of Slovenia became a sovereign national state, which in 2004 joined
                    both the European Union and NATO, and is today a member of numerous other
                    international organizations.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-18">This work addresses a number of the issues and developments that
                    defined the lives of Slovenes in the Habsburg Empire, the inter-war Kingdom of
                    SHS/Yugoslavia and the post-war Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It
                    makes especial reference to the Second World War, a period marked by invasion
                    and occupation, collaboration and resistance, revolution and civil war, which
                    was the most challenging period in the history of the nation and has fatefully
                    marked both ideological and political relations among Slovenes.</p>

                    social coexistence in Slovenia? Because the concept helps us include an
                    important dimension of social and political practices significant for the
                    comprehension of various processes that could be overlooked by a general
                    historiographical analysis of democratization, modernization, parliamentarism
                    and political/ideological struggles. What do we mean with the concept of
                    coexistence? We are using the term as a conceptual tool for the analysis of the
                    processes of (dis)regard and inclusion/exclusion practised by social and
                    political groups. Let us define social groups in a broader sense: as communities
                    of people who acknowledge the existence of these communities and their
                    affiliation with them. This definition does not imply anything about the
                    homogeneity and margins of these groups.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="1">

                <p xml:id="p-21">The fundamental questions of our research are: Does the group
                    acknowledge other groups that it perceives as antagonistic or as competition as
                    equal (at least in principle)? Does the group's value system allow for the
                    existence of other such groups? Does the value system upheld by the other group
                    acknowledge the right to existence of the first group or does it see it as a
                    threat to its values? We are interested in coexistence at two levels: as a value
                    and as a practice. The levels are not necessarily equal. Such coexistence also
                    doesn't require groups to associate or try to reconcile their beliefs; they may
                    exist in "parallel worlds" and "respectfully ignore" each other while still
                    acknowledging the existence of the "other".</p>

                    <p xml:id="p-22">We are also using the concept of coexistence because it
                        complements other concepts necessary to understand such processes, e.g.
                        modernization, parliamentarism, pluralism, liberalism, representation and –
                        of course – democracy. Of all the concepts listed, the latter is perhaps the
                        most heterogeneous and yet crucial for the period following the revolutions
                        of the 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                        centuries. We cannot delve into a detailed analysis of the concept of
                        democracy in time and space at this time; if we want to understand the
                        relationship between coexistence and democracy in early 20<hi
                            rend="superscript">th</hi> century, however, it is necessary to know
                        some of the fundamental shifts in the meaning of the concept. Before the
                        revolutionary period, only theoretical treatises ever used the concept of
                        democracy. The great majority of theoreticians stuck to Aristotle's logic,
                        according to which democracy was unachievable in large countries and only
                        possible in small political entities if certain conditions are met.
                        Democracy was understood to only mean the direct (pure, absolute) democracy
                        of the idealized Athenian type where everybody (the whole demos) decides
                        upon everything.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="2">

                        centuries who are generally regarded as the "fathers" of the modern
                        conception of politics saw the biggest issue with democracy in the feuding
                        of different "factions". <persName

                        was convinced that the republican rule may be either aristocratic or
                        democratic. However, the main precondition for the existence of a republican
                        government according to <persName
                            ref="#pers-MontesquieuCharles-LouisdeSecondat">Montesquieu</persName>
                        was "public virtue" – a desire for the common good – of the ruling people.
                        If the virtue is practically absent in despotism and unnecessary in a
                        monarchy, it is crucial to the operation of a republic.<note place="foot"

                        common good, the republic would dissolve in the struggles of various
                        factions. The destructiveness of factions was also stressed by <persName
                            ref="#pers-HumeDavid">David Hume</persName> who preferred the concept of
                        the republic to that of democracy. <persName ref="#pers-HumeDavid"
                            >Hume</persName> resolved the problem of feuding factions by advocating
                        representation of people from larger political entities. In his opinion,
                        representatives of the people from larger entities would have to consider a
                        broader range of interests, reducing the possibility of feuding between
                        factions. <persName ref="#pers-RousseauJean-Jacques">Rousseau</persName> was
                        even more critical of democracy. In The Social Contract, <persName

                        that democracy was incompatible with representative institutions. According

                        in representative democracy, supporting (albeit ambiguously) the idea of a

                            <bibl>Ibid., p. 21</bibl>.</note> Democracy got a new dimension with the
                        creation of the USA and with the French Revolution. The idea of representing
                        the people allowed for the implementation of democracy in large countries.
                        However, the idea of representatives being elected by the people was
                        accompanied by two fundamental problems: the inevitability of parties
                        (movements, factions) and the question of the electorate. Both are central
                        to the issue of the coexistence of differences.</p>
                    <p xml:id="p-23">The fact that the term "democracy" had freed itself from the
                        grasp of social theory and started a political life of its own is also of
                        some significance. "Democracy" thus came to mean more than it used to in the
                        constitutional/political sense. It became a self-descriptive word for many
                        different political groups and a name for new constitutional institutions.
                        Most of all though, the concept was expanded with general social and
                        historical/philosophical content. This led to concepts such as social
                        democracy, Christian democracy, etc. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn9" n="6">

                        as the advent of the bourgeois society coincided with the idea of popular
                        representation gradually but surely becoming dominant and realized within
                        state institutions (parliament), "democracy" came to mean unmanageably many
                        things. Different breeds of radicals of various national convictions in
                        1848, such as the emerging socialists and conservatives, understood it
                        differently from each other. The term "democracy" had a special relationship
                        with liberalism as a political movement and as an ideology of the
                        bourgeoisie. The form of political organization typical of liberalism was
                        the representative government based on an elected parliament that did not
                        represent social interests or communities (as it was under the old regime)
                        but rather groups of legally equal individuals.<note place="foot"

                        participation of the "masses" in political decision-making. However, the
                        liberals at the "top" did not trust the "masses" to be capable of rational
                        political decisions. What to do? Limit the right to vote and act as popular
                        representatives, as those who know what is best for the people.<note

                        people wield "ultimate control" over their government. Such control may
                        instead go hand in hand with popular fascism in which the dictator enjoys
                        the spontaneous support of the majority. Similarly, democracy does not equal
                        majority rule, a system where the government is controlled by the majority.
                        The majority of the electorate can force the adoption of undemocratic rules.
                        Democracy is different from sovereignty of the people and majority rule
                        because democracy is a normative idea associated with substantial political
                        values, while "sovereignty of the people" and "majority rule" are
                        descriptive terms that apply to individual decision-making processes.<note

                        the history of our area and often ignored by authors from the West: the
                        Marxist view and the Catholic view. However, the subject of relationships
                        between democracy and Marxism and democracy and Catholicism is too complex
                        for the scope of this article. The Catholic Church, as the most stable
                        community conceived in pre-modern age, did not greet democracy with open
                        arms. In continental Europe, parliamentary democracy was born out of
                        revolution and secularization. The pluralism of political groups ran counter
                        to the idea of a hierarchical, "harmonious" country.<note place="foot"

                        ideologues of political Catholicism were quick to realize the signs of the

                        for them to enter the plural political sphere as well. Because Catholicism,
                        which established itself as a bastion against godless modernization in the

                        towards democracy, wavering between various shades of total rejection of
                        constitutionality/parliamentarism and a deep confidence in the power of the
                        people, between a pure monarchic principle and the glorification of
                        universal suffrage. In general, however, Catholic theorists were using all
                        available philosophical and sociological means to reconcile democracy with
                        the Catholic model of an organic hierarchical community, usually according
                        to the logic that democracy is acceptable only if it is true, i.e.

                        Slovenia. Why is this important? Slovenian press (and to a lesser degree
                        historiography) is extremely partial to the idea of Slovenian divisiveness.
                        Authors of various convictions and leanings see divisiveness as something a
                        priori Slovenian, as a typical Slovenian trait. Let us look at a couple of
                        examples. For instance, in his interpretation of Slovenian history,
                            <persName ref="#pers-BučarFrance">France Bučar</persName> posited that
                        discrimination according to ideology was "characteristic of the whole
                        duration of our national consciousness". Supposedly, a distinctive feature
                        of Slovenian society at the beginning of the 21<hi rend="superscript"
                            >st</hi> century are the divisions "that had been created in the past".
                            <persName ref="#pers-BučarFrance">Bučar</persName> identifies the "fact"
                        that Slovenian national consciousness developed through proclamations of
                        Catholicism as an element of the national essence as the central problem in
                        this regard. According to <persName ref="#pers-BučarFrance"
                        >Bučar</persName>, any association with tendencies not originating in
                        Catholicism (e.g. liberalism, socialism) was seen as disloyalty to the
                        nation. This intolerance to anything even slightly different was supposedly
                        exploited by communism that abused the emancipatory pattern of the

                        entanglement in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, Slovenes supposedly found a
                        "safe haven" in the Church. The Church became a "mother of the nation" and
                        came to define the nation's existence. The development of democracy in the
                        context of modernity was thus supposedly frustrated by "liberalism and
                        communism by limiting themselves to the culture war".<note place="foot"

                    <p xml:id="p-28">What is the common denominator of all these extremely different
                        views of the "Slovenian schism"? It is primarily their unhistorical
                        perspective, i.e. the assessment of historical development from today's
                        perspective, from the viewpoint of the observer who is familiar with the
                        future stages of development. However, such a viewpoint is only seemingly
                        broad. In truth, it obscures important issues that are essential to the
                        historiographical interpretation and can only be caught if we are very
                        familiar with the characteristics of the space and time under investigation.
                        The people who lived "then" did not know what we know "now". Another
                        characteristic common to all the above views is the near (or complete)
                        absence of the national and social contexts. The Habsburg Monarchy is
                        presented as a kind of stage on which the history of Slovenian disputes is
                        unfolding, not as an important factor whose mere structure of government
                        determined various parameters of development (cultural, political,
                        economic). A perennialist idea of the nation is also frequently typical:
                        that nations supposedly existed in all historical period even though
                        nationalist ideology is of a much later date.<note place="foot"
                            xml:id="ftn30" n="27">Although the author treats nationalism as a modern
                            phenomenon, he is also well aware of the importance of the ethnosymbolic
                            perspective ("prehistory" of the nation). A brief overview of theories

                        Such analyses often hide a very contemporary "secret message" between the
                        lines (e.g. clericals/liberals were evil/good in the past, so they are still
                        evil/good). Another typical feature of these authors is their investigation
                        of who was more responsible for the "culture war" and whose contributions to
                        Slovenian history were positive/negative. History is life's teacher, after
                        all. Regardless of the potentially opposite intentions of their authors,
                        such interpretations reproduce the myth of Slovenian divisiveness by newly
                        constructing it through criticism. The author of this article does not wish
                        to insinuate that the journalist viewpoint or the viewpoints of other
                        humanities are wrong. Journalism (or political, philosophical, theological,
                        literary analysis) can uncover many things that the historian would
                        overlook. However, this is not a historical analysis but rather something
                        else. In parallel with the journalist, i.e. non-historical conceptualization
                        of political divisions in early 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century,
                        there exists a developing discipline of academic historiography that deals
                        with the issues of political coexistence in broad temporal and spatial
                        contexts. In the next section, we will refer to this tradition and
                        complement it with a list of comparative historiography monographs dealing
                        with the Habsburg Monarchy.</p>

                        democratization of the sphere of politics. On the eve of the March
                        Revolution, the "Austrian Empire" was an absolutist country that embodied

                        Slovenian political and general social spheres. There is also the question
                        of whether the historian of today is even able to understand the

                        Habsburg Monarchy is connected to the great debate on Germany's special
                        path, the "Sonderweg", that, in the late 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                        century, raged throughout the German historiography of the 19<hi
                            rend="superscript">th</hi> and 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                        centuries. The proponents of the special path hypothesis explained the rise
                        of National Socialism with the special, conservative modernization of
                        Germany, in which the successful socio-economic modernization was not
                        followed by an effective political modernization that would lead towards
                        modern democracy. The rule of old, traditional elites supposedly blocked the
                        parliamentarization of the system. The "Sonderwegdebatte" had various twists
                        and turns, however, we cannot simply divide its participants into proponents
                        and opponents of the special path hypothesis. That is, various proponents of
                        the "Sonderweg" had very different interpretations of it. According to
                        American historian <persName ref="#pers-ShedelJames">James
                        Shedel</persName>, the heart of the special path hypothesis is the
                        conviction that France, Great Britain and the U.S. represent the "normative
                        development models", meaning that the progressiveness of other countries
                        should be measured by their success at "implementing" the fundamental
                        characteristics of these models.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn40" n="37">

                        financial troubles and opposition of the bourgeoisie, the Monarchy was even

                        between individuals, social groups and state institutions, while the concept
                        of political culture is focused on long-term "cultural patterns" that are
                        transmitted from generation to generation. In other words: The concept of

                        1870, the European ruling elites recognized that democratization was
                        inevitable. The electorate started to expand. Universal and equal suffrage
                        for men was spreading through Europe, with the matter of women's suffrage
                        gaining increasing traction as well. This naturally resulted in the
                        political mobilization of the masses and in the creation of parties of the
                        masses. However, these parties of the masses did not replace patrician
                        politics – patricians merely had to adapt to the new circumstances.
                        Well-organized mass political movements were not "republics of equals". The
                        combination of hierarchical organization and mass popular support provided
                        these parties with great potential: such parties became potential states.
                        Democratization, occurring in the time of great social transformations and
                        crises, brought about new problems. The unity (and even the existence) of
                        various countries came to be questioned due to ineffectual parliaments,
                        demagogy and insurmountable disputes between parties. "Men of independent
                        wealth" were being pushed out of politics by men who had founded their
                        careers and wealth on success in the new political environment.<note

                        Monarchy threatened the positions of established parties of wealthy
                        landowners, the conservative clergy and the moneyed and educated
                        bourgeoisie. These new movements challenged the notions of the community
                        espoused by the "old" conservatives and liberals, replacing them with their
                        own populist conception of society/community, regardless of whether they
                        were the proponents of radical nationalism and anti-Semitism, Catholic or
                        secular agrarianism, urban social Catholicism or social democracy.<note

                        dominated the Austrian part of the Monarchy as the ruling formation until
                        1879. The German liberals espoused a pluralist vision, according to which
                        individuals must be free to develop their own potentials. However, as noted
                        by <persName ref="#pers-JudsonPieterM.">Judson</persName>, the individual's
                        choice was limited to the possibilities available within the context of the
                        German bourgeoisie. The liberals' problem was not that they did not (in a
                        certain sense) expand the rights to new groups of people, but rather that
                        they made these rights too conditional: "Have these rights, but be like us."
                        Other groups preferred to fight for their rights on their own terms, for
                        which they used the basic political structures left behind by the German
                            liberals.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn68" n="65">

                        represent the common interest, it became increasingly clear after 1880 that
                        they in truth represent nobody but themselves. The German liberals jumped on
                        the wagon that they had been following for decades: integral German
                        nationalism. They were thus able to preserve the role of their parties deep
                        within the period of mass politics, especially in nationally mixed

                        The crisis also brought the "art" of parliamentary obstruction to a higher
                        level: obstruction became an everyday means used in order to achieve
                        concrete political goals. Various parties obstructed the functioning of the
                        parliament in order to obtain certain concessions, returning to normal
                        political practice only when they got what they wanted. The other face of
                        the Cisleithanian political system in the final decades of the Monarchy was
                        represented by the complex mechanisms of political negotiation between the
                        parties and state administration that allowed the latter to function. Among

                        the number of workers' and peasants' representatives), it did not wholly
                        eliminate the unequal representation of provinces. Also, in spite of a
                        lively suffragette movement, women remained disenfranchised.<note

                        attention to nationality", in Slovenia (Austria) until that time and also
                        later Slovenians were usually referred to as the rural population, while
                        Germans (or Italians) were seen as the urban and town population. In the
                        political sense, the majority population was distinctively provincially
                        oriented. Cities and towns were considered German (or Italian) purely on the
                        basis of linguistic differences with the countryside, as a sign of legal and
                        social distinctiveness. After the restoration of the constitutional life,
                        the nationalist aspirations led to a decisive push in the direction of
                        nationalism, as the bourgeoisie was forced to declare itself

                        anti-Slovenian policy of the Gorizia Italians. However, in the beginning of

                        supported the idea (originally stemming from the liberal camp) of

                        The liberals, alarmed by the loss of their leading position in establishing

                        the point of no return had been crossed. The Slovenian-Croatian mutuality
                        and approximation became an everyday political routine. Nevertheless, after
                        the Rijeka Resolution, adopted by almost all Croatian parties in October
                        1905, the Slovenian political line was left completely on its own.<note

                    Vitus’ Day Constitution, decisively marking the political life in the Kingdom of
                    SHS, were the Yugoslav national unitarianism and state centralism. The
                    Constitution deprived Slovenians, Croatians and Serbs (the names of other
                    nations were not even mentioned) of their national individuality and
                    incorporated them as an invented single national (Yugoslav) entity into a strict
                    centralist Yugoslav state context. The already formed Yugoslav national
                    entities, defined by the Constitution simply as "tribes" of the single
                    (Yugoslav) nation, were therefore formally and legally condemned to national
                    erasure. The national unitarianism of the St. Vitus’ Day Constitution was
                    substantiated by the provisions designed specifically to this end, i.e. that the
                    "official language of the Monarchy (...) is Serbo-Croat-Slovene" and its
                    citizens were – with the exception of the minorities belonging to "other tribes
                    and languages" – of Serbo-Croat-Slovene nationality. In addition to these
                    provisions, the national unity principle was also asserted by certain other
                    provisions: the provision that the King and Heir Apparent should declare, in
                    their oath in front of the National Assembly, to protect the "unity of the
                    nation"; the provision that all schools should "provide moral education and
                    develop civic consciousness in the spirit of national unity"; the provision on
                    banning the newspapers and press which might incite "tribal discord"; and the
                    provision that all citizens had the obligation to "serve the interests of the
                    national community".<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn197" n="194">

                    the Interior and appointed by the King, were subordinate to the Belgrade
                    government and in fact merely state officials adhering to the decisions of the
                    central administration. Thereby the central administration did not only gain
                    control over the head mayors, but also over the authorities of the
                    constitutionally guaranteed self-governance of the administrative units – i.e.
                    the Administrative Unit Assemblies (their jurisdiction included especially the
                    financial and economic matters of the administrative units). According to the
                    law on general administration, the head mayors as the political representatives
                    of the government also represented this government in the administrative unit
                    self-governances. They had sufficient autonomy to withhold, of their own accord,
                    the execution of any decisions taken by the self-governance authorities and not
                    warranted by the Constitution, legal acts, or administrative unit decrees. The
                    decisions of the head mayors could only be appealed at the state council – i.e.
                    the supreme administrative court whose members were appointed by the King and
                    the National Assembly. The self-governance and self-governing powers of the
                    administrative units, warranted by the St. Vitus' Day Constitution, were
                    therefore subordinate to the decisions of the head mayors and the state council.
                    In view of all these considerations the self-governance of the administrative
                    units by no means undermined the centralist state system codified in the St.
                    Vitus' Day Constitution, because the self-governance authorities of the
                    administrative units were subordinate to the supreme central administration.
                    According to the St. Vitus' Day Constitution, the institute of self-governance
                    of the administrative units was based purely on the technical division of state
                    administration. Thus, according to the <hi rend="italic">iure delegatio</hi>
                    principle, the self-governance authorities at the administrative unit level
                    carried out, on behalf of the central state authorities, a part of their tasks,
                    while at the same time they were still subordinate to the central Belgrade
                    administration. The St. Vitus' Day Constitution and the resulting administrative
                    and self-governance arrangement thereby created a comprehensive and impenetrable
                    centralist state system which precluded the artificially formed administrative
                    territorial units from taking independent decisions with regard to public
                        matters.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn199" n="196">

                <p xml:id="p-69">The national-political and state-legal development in the Yugoslav
                    state was also substantiated in a similar manner after the introduction of the
                    personal dictatorship of King <persName ref="#pers-KarađorđevićAleksander"
                        >Alexander Karađorđević</persName> on 6 January 1929. On that day King
                    Alexander abolished the St.Vitus' Day Constitution, dissolved the National
                    Assembly, and disabled the driving force of the democratic parliamentary system
                    – the political parties – by prohibiting and dissolving them. By the end of 1929
                    he renewed the enactment of the Yugoslav national unitarianism and state
                    centralism. In the Act Amending the Protection of Public Security and Order Act
                    of 6 January 1929 he again defined Slovenians, Croats and Serbs as "tribes" of
                    the single Yugoslav nation. He went even further in the law on the name and
                    division of the Kingdom, declared on 3 October 1929. The Yugoslav national
                    unitarianism was also enacted with the new state name, as King Alexander changed
                    the name of the Kingdom, previously composed of three "tribal" names – Serbian,
                    Croatian and Slovenian – into a single Yugoslav name covering all of the
                    national individualities. Thus, as of October 1929, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia
                    came into existence and was newly divided into nine Banates. Consequently the
                    administrative units of Ljubljana and Maribor were merged into the Drava Banate,
                    which encompassed the whole Slovenian territory in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia
                    with the exception of the districts of Črnomelj and Metlika, but with the
                    Croatian district of Čabar. These districts were then exchanged between the
                    Drava Banate and the neighbouring Sava Banate on 28 August 1931, which allowed
                    for the adjustment to ethnic borders. However, the new administrative division
                    into individual Banates – in the Slovenian case adapted to the ethnic borders –
                    never challenged the principle of state centralism. The Banates were
                    administrative-territorial units, directly subordinate to the central state
                    administration in Belgrade regardless of their legally guaranteed general
                    administrative jurisdictions. The Bans, who implemented the highest political
                    and general administrative powers in the Banates, were merely representatives of
                    the King's government. The Bans and all senior officials of the Banate
                    administration were proposed by the Minister of the Interior and appointed by
                    the King, while the members of the Bans' advisory bodies – Bans' Councils – were
                    proposed by the Bans and appointed or replaced by the Minister of the Interior.
                    The Banates therefore never negated centralism, although they represented a
                    specific manner of administrative decentralisation in the Yugoslav unitarian
                    state. Thereby the Banate administration was only one of the steps in the
                    completely one-tier system of the Yugoslav state authorities' strict hierarchic
                        scale.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn200" n="197">

                    centralist Yugoslav national-state reality was decisive for defining the
                    relationship between Slovenians and Yugoslavia, between the nation and the
                    state. Slovenians responded to this question in different ways. There was a
                    division of opinion among them regarding the decision whether to accept the
                    merging with the imaginary Yugoslav nation or resist such a national fate and
                    fight, on the basis of the conscience of the specific Slovenian national
                    individuality, for the right to the Slovenian language, culture and national
                    statehood, which could be ensured by the Yugoslav state union reorganised in the
                    autonomist or federal manner. The majority of the Slovenian nation and
                    politicians opted for the Slovenian autonomist-federalist position, which was
                    shared in the entire Slovenian political space of that time through individual
                    political subjects or public servants. In the 1920s the Slovenian

                    Party and the Slovenian People's Party. These two parties were the first to
                    substantiate, in concrete terms, the right to and appeal for the statehood of
                    the Slovenian nation within the Yugoslav state community. Thus the Slovenian
                    Republican Party, claiming that the Slovenian nation was sufficiently mature to
                    manage itself and breathe with "its own lungs", demanded absolute national
                    sovereignty and statehood for Slovenians according to the examples of
                    Switzerland and the United States of America. It insisted on the transformation
                    of the Kingdom of SHS into a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which would not
                    only include Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia but Bulgaria as well. In the beginning
                    of February 1923 this party presented a detailed explication of its state-legal
                    programme and pointed out that Slovenia would be an independent state within the
                    Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with its own National Assembly and state
                    administration, connected to the other federal units only as an equal state
                    component of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Federal Republic of
                    Yugoslavia would be a state composed of separate units, where only the following
                    elements would be common: the army (whereby Slovenians would serve the military
                    in Slovenia), Ministry of Foreign Affairs (with a certain number of Slovenian
                    and Croatian members according to a commonly agreed formula), finances (they
                    would be common only in the common matters), currency (it would only have a
                    common design, while the banknotes would only have either Slovenian, Croatian,
                    Serbian or Bulgarian inscriptions), trade agreements with foreign countries,
                    customs and tariffs, and the President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
                    For one mandate of "three or four years", the President would be Slovenian, for
                    the next he would be Croatian, then Serbian, and then Bulgarian.<note

                    shared their view with other unitarian and centralist political forces in

                    the natural and historically substantiated end of the previously separate

                    represent a reason, in the national and state sense, for their existence in the

                    Slovenian political liberalism expressed its adherence to the Yugoslav national
                    integralism most emphatically in the middle of the 1930s, when the leading JNS
                    politicians from the Drava, Sava and Primorska Banates (Slovenia and Croatia
                    with Dalmatia and Herzegovina) drew up the so-called Pohorje Declaration on 19
                    and 20 August 1935 under the leadership of the Slovenian liberal leader Dr.
                        <persName ref="#pers-KramerAlbert">Albert Kramer</persName>. In this
                    Declaration the liberals presented their outlook on the national issue yet
                    again. According to them, Serbs, Croats and Slovenians were <hi rend="italic">"a

                    was <hi rend="italic">"a sense of the internal connection between Serbs, Croats

                    argued in favour of the Yugoslav state centralism. This became most apparent in
                    January 1933, when it opposed the so-called Ljubljana Declaration – a federal
                    state-legal programme, outlined by the former Slovenian People's Party on 31
                    December 1932 – extremely resolutely. The Ljubljana Declaration, which called
                    for the establishment of a Slovenian federal unit (apart from the Serbian and

                    the Ban's Council of the Drava Banate, which, in the first half of the 1930s,
                    consisted of the liberals. The liberal Ban's Councillors may have demanded the
                    broadening of the Ban's Council jurisdiction when it came to drawing up the
                    budget. However, their demands, in view of the fundamental liberal centralist

                    the Kingdom of Yugoslavia the liberals refused to listen to the wider Slovenian
                    aspirations for the establishment of an autonomous Slovenian state-legal unit in
                    the Yugoslav community. They remained the only political factor to avoid the
                    Slovenian national problem in their political ideas and practices. Thus the
                    liberals narrowed their political space considerably, and this was one of the
                    factors leading to their political decline in the second half of the 1930s.</p>

                    anti-regime protests in Šenčur during the gathering of the JRKD. Gendarmerie
                    intervened and fired shots in the air. This was followed by extensive
                    demonstrations against the regime all around Slovenia. At this time the SLS also
                    sought the support of the Church. The celebrations of <persName

                    aforementioned Ljubljana Declaration, also referred to as <persName
                        ref="#pers-KorošecAnton">Korošec's</persName> Declaration or Slovenian
                    Declaration, were even more resounding. The regime responded resolutely and
                    ordered the confinement of the members of the highest SLS leadership, including
                        <persName ref="#pers-KorošecAnton">Anton Korošec</persName>. After its
                    leaders were confined (they were allowed to go free after the death of King
                    Alexander in October 1934) and until the change of the regime in June 1935 the
                    SLS no longer emphasised the federalist demands, but it did not forget them.
                    This especially proved to be true in the second half of the 1930s, when the
                    former Slovenian People's Party – as a part of the ruling Yugoslav Radical
                    Association, another all‑Yugoslav political party which existed in the 1930s –
                    once again, though gradually, started making demands for the national assertion
                    of Slovenians and autonomist reorganisation of the state. Apart from the SLS,
                    various political groups, movements and associations made demands for the
                    Slovenian national emancipation at that time as well. The issue was emphasised
                    by the peasant and workers' movement (in their gazettes Slovenska zemlja,
                    Ljudska pravica, Delavska politika, Delavski obzornik, Neodvisnost, and
                    Edinost), the socially-progressive movement gathered around the Slovenska beseda
                    gazette, and the Catholic-corporatist oriented groups gathered around the
                    gazettes Straža v viharju and Mi mladi borci. The same demands were also
                    strongly supported by the People's Front movement. Its protagonists – the
                    communists, Slovenian-oriented national democratic intelligentsia, Christian
                    socialist and the transformed national democratic Slovenian Sokol organisation –
                    were brought together by the self-confident emphasising of the Slovenian
                    national autonomy as well as the clear and resolute demand for the Slovenian
                    national self-determination and autonomist-federal transformation of the
                    Yugoslav state. The equality of Slovenians and their self-governance – meaning
                    such a Yugoslav state as to ensure the existence, unobstructed development and
                    free self-expression of the Slovenian nation in all the areas of its linguistic,
                    cultural, national, economic and political life – was also argued for by the
                    national democratic groups that had distanced themselves from the policies of
                    the liberals due to their support of the undemocratic regime and Yugoslav
                    unitarianism. The majority of these groups were established in the middle of the
                    1930s (the Slovenian supporters of <persName ref="#pers-MačekIvan"
                        >Maček</persName>, the Association of Peasant Boys and Girls Societies, the
                    democratically transformed Slovenian Sokoli organisation). Meanwhile, the first
                    groups to break away from the Slovenian liberal unitarian policy between 1932
                    and 1933 were, apart from <persName ref="#pers-VidmarJosip">Josip
                        Vidmar</persName> with his work Kulturni problem slovenstva (Cultural
                    Problem of Slovenian Identity), the cultural and scientific workers of the
                    liberal-national orientation, gathered around the Sodobnost magazine. At the
                    same time the Slovenian national standpoint was also supported by the group
                    gathered around the Slovenija gazette. Thus an authentic Slovenian national
                    orientation, which continued the Slovenian liberal autonomism from the 1920s,
                    also existed within the liberal camp in the 1930s. It was based on the ideas of
                    the most prominent Slovenian liberal minds of the time: <persName

                    Even though the autonomist-federalist orientation was supported by the majority
                    of the Slovenian politics and many interesting and detailed state-legal plans of
                    how the Slovenian autonomy was to be substantiated were drawn up in its context,
                    the question of its realisation only began to define the actual dimensions of
                    the Slovenian autonomism. Only some of the contemporaneous Slovenian autonomist
                    ambitions were realised in the First Yugoslavia. The first goals were reached in
                    the time of the aforementioned administrative unit self-governances between 1927
                    and 1929, when the strongest Slovenian political party – Slovenian People's
                    Party – established a sort of a "silent autonomy" in Slovenia. As it was, on 23
                    January 1927 the elections for the Administrative Unit Assemblies took place,
                    and the SLS received the majority of votes on the basis of its autonomist
                    programme in the Ljubljana and Maribor administrative units. During the
                    constitution of the Administrative Unit Assemblies a month later, its deputies
                    elected the representatives of the SLS as the Presidents of the Ljubljana and
                    Maribor Administrative Assemblies and their executive bodies – the
                    Administrative Unit Committees. Furthermore, both head mayors of the Ljubljana
                    and Maribor administrative units, appointed on 28 February 1927, belonged to the
                    ranks of the SLS as well. Because the SLS judged it could take advantage of the
                    existing political circumstances and at least partly implement its autonomist
                    ideas through the administrative self-governance, simultaneously ensuring its
                    authority and domination in Slovenia, it entered the government in February
                    1927. Thus it opted for pragmatism after long years of being on the side of the
                    opposition.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-81">The introduction of administrative unit self-governances meant a
                    partial alleviation of the strict centralist state-legal system implemented by
                    the St. Vitus' Day Constitution. Thus we can also refer to the period when this
                    took place – from the formal establishment on 23 February 1927 until the
                    introduction of the King's dictatorship on 6 January 1929, when the
                    Administrative Unit Assemblies were abolished – as the time when Slovenian
                    parliamentarism came to life in the First Yugoslavia. This period was
                    characterised by the intense endeavours of the SLS to ensure – through the
                    administrative unit self‑governances and under its leadership – as much
                    independence in the management of the important socio-economic and
                    cultural-educational affairs as possible, because the centralist state
                    administration had been either addressing these issues inappropriately or
                    neglecting them for many years. In the first half of 1927 both Slovenian
                    administrative unit self-governances took over a variety of jurisdictions from
                    the Ljubljana and Maribor head mayors in accordance with the provisions of the
                    St. Vitus' Day Constitution and the subsequent government Decree on the
                    Administrative Unit and District Self-Governance: the control of municipalities
                    and local self-governances, as well as the management of the former provincial
                    assets. Later these administrative units also organised their own financial
                    institutions. In the time when the SLS was still in the government – until the
                    middle of April 1927 – the Belgrade National Assembly also gave the Slovenian
                    Administrative Unit Assemblies the right to amend, supplement and abolish the
                    former provincial laws in line with the constitution and state legislation. Thus
                    the Slovenian Administrative Unit Assemblies also had a broader legislative
                    jurisdiction. A year later, in March 1928, both Slovenian administrative unit
                    self-governances were the only administrative units in the state to also receive
                    – according to a special authorisation from the National Assembly – the right to
                    change certain important decrees of the National Government of SHS in Ljubljana
                    as well as those of the Provincial Government for Slovenia from 1918–1921. Thus
                    they had the right to adopt not only the executive decrees accompanying the laws
                    passed in the National Assembly, but also legally binding regulations – <hi
                        rend="italic">de facto</hi> they even started to carry out limited
                    legislative functions. This privilege resulted from the participation of the SLS
                    in the government. The asymmetric implementation of the administrative unit
                    self-governance in Slovenia gave rise to criticism, especially in Croatia, where
                    they referred to the Slovenian administrative units as "a state within the
                    state".</p>
                <p xml:id="p-82">After its repeated victory at the Assembly elections on 11
                    September 1927, the SLS once again entered the government on the basis of the
                    renowned Bled Agreement, reached by the SLS and the Serbian National Radical
                    Party on 11 July 1927, and numerous jurisdictions and institutions were
                    transferred from the individual ministries to the Slovenian administrative unit
                    self-governances. The SLS remained in the government until the onset of the
                    King's dictatorship. In comparison with other self-governances in the state, in
                    the second half of 1927 the Ljubljana and Maribor administrative unit
                    self-governances took over – from the individual line ministries – the greatest
                    share of matters and institutions in the field of public construction,
                    agriculture, non-agrarian industries, health, social welfare and vocational
                    education. Furthermore, their administrative unit budgets for the years 1928 and
                    1929, which ensured the financial foundations for their operation and were the
                    largest in the state, were confirmed by the Minister of Finance swiftly and
                    without any complications. In this context the centralist authorities managed to
                    attain their goal: to relieve the central budget of the obligations to finance
                    the individual administrative units. Namely, those self-governances that wanted
                    to carry out their tasks successfully – of these the Slovenian self-governances
                    were especially prominent – had to rely mostly on their own resources for the
                    preparation of their budgets. This imposed an additional tax burden on the
                    Slovenian population, which was severely criticised by the opposition.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-83">The introduction of the dictatorship put an end to the two-year
                    period when Slovenians managed a wide range of important matters on their own,
                    especially in the socio-economic field. At this time both Slovenian
                    administrative unit self-governances functioned as a single Slovenian
                    administrative unit, in so far as this was possible in accordance with the
                    legislation. However, the efforts to organise joint sessions of both
                    Administrative Unit Assemblies as a kind of a Slovenian Parliament were
                    unsuccessful. The Slovenian Administrative Unit Assemblies also strived to
                    function in accordance with the model of the Belgrade Parliament – with limited
                    competences, of course. As a wide range of issues, including political, were
                    addressed, the pluralism of the outlooks of all of the twelve parties,
                    represented in the Slovenian Administrative Unit Assemblies at the time, came to
                    the forefront. In this sense the Ljubljana and Maribor Administrative Unit
                    Assemblies were even forerunners, of a sort, of the Slovenian Parliament,
                    elected in April 1990. Otherwise, in the intervening periods, the Slovenian
                    representative bodies consisted of a single party.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-84">The Slovenian self-governances achieved their greatest successes in
                    the economic field – in public construction and encouragement of the development
                    of agrarian industry. One of their exceedingly important achievements was also
                    the organisation of the health system in the context of addressing the social
                    issues. They also managed to improve the situation in education and culture. The
                    leading political factor in Slovenia at the time – the SLS – also exploited the
                    activities of both administrative unit self-governances for its own party gains,
                    which was criticised resolutely by the opposition. However, we should emphasise
                    that the most visible achievements of the SLS benefitted everyone, or served the
                    general Slovenian interests.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-85">Through the activities of the two administrative unit
                    self-governances between 1927 and 1929, Slovenians demonstrated their own will
                    and capacity to independently solve the important issues pertaining to their
                    development. Despite the exaggerated – and on the other hand undervalued –
                    estimates with regard to the results of the activities of both Slovenian
                    administrative unit self-governances, we should underline the fact that the
                    financial situation and organisation of all the activities and institutions
                    taken over by these two self-governances improved swiftly and significantly in
                    comparison with their condition during the year-long centralist management.
                    However, the successful operation of the Slovenian self-governances –
                    significantly more efficient than in the other thirty-one administrative units
                    in the state – nevertheless remained far from the successful implementation of
                    the programmes of Slovenian legislative autonomy with a Slovenian parliament and
                    government, which had been comprehensively outlined already in the 1920s.<note

                    its King's Ban's Administration were formed. The Ban took over all the affairs
                    of the general administration and the former self-governance, and he carried out

                    consultative body since 1931, strengthened its role in the adoption of the
                    budget. The main task of the Ban's Council was to comment on the Ban's budget

                    developed from the focused local framework into thorough debates about all the
                    outstanding economic, financial, social, health, educational and cultural issues
                    and the activities of the public administration. Occasionally they also touched
                    upon political issues and reflected all of the current affairs in Slovenia. Such
                    functioning of the Ban's Council was encouraged by the SLS after it had entered
                    the government in the summer of 1935. The SLS leader <persName
                        ref="#pers-KorošecAnton">Anton Korošec</persName>, who became the Minister
                    of the Interior, used his function to ensure that the leading positions in the
                    authorities of the Drava Banate and the majority of those in the Ban's Council
                    were taken over by the members of his party. With the domination of the SLS
                    adherents in the Ban's Council – who, like in the first half of the 1930s when
                    the Ban's Administration was in the hands of the liberals, exploited their
                    administrative privileges to secure party benefits – the specific circumstances
                    from the time when administrative unit self-governance had been in force were
                    restored. The Ban's Council became an increasingly important factor in solving
                    the issues relevant to the socio-economic and cultural-educational progress of
                    Slovenia. A new era in the efforts for an autonomous Slovenia began. The demands
                    for the Slovenian economic, financial, social and cultural independence as well
                    as equality of the Slovenian language in the official affairs became more
                    numerous, and the name "Slovenia" increasingly often replaced the designation
                    "Drava Banate" in the Ban's Council discussions. These demands were made by the
                    Ban's Councillors at each session. The autonomist endeavours of the Ban's
                    Council reached their peak on 17 February 1940, when it adopted the resolution
                    on the establishment of a separate state-legal unit, the Banate of Slovenia. At
                    this point the Ban's Councillors also underlined that the Ban's Council should
                    be immediately replaced with an elected Banate Assembly, which would, among
                    other things, be responsible for all the aspects of the Banate budget as well as
                    enjoy legislative competence. The resolution on the establishment of the Banate
                    of Slovenia reflected the existing state of affairs in Slovenia, where during
                    the second half of the 1930s life in fact proceeded independently and according
                    to the will of Slovenians, even in the absence of the formal legal basis for

                <p xml:id="p-88">The demand for the establishment of the Banate of Slovenia in
                    February 1940 was made in the time when the Ban's Administration of the Drava
                    Banate had already carried out the intense preparations for the establishment of
                    the Slovenian Banate after September 1939. The work was undertaken after the
                    establishment of the Banate of Croatia on 26 August 1939, which had a special
                    state-legal position and certain features of statehood in the context of the
                    Kingdom of Yugoslavia. When the Banate of Croatia was established, the Yugoslav
                    state leadership also provided for the possibility of the formation of other
                    state-legal units (Banates) in the country. A special commission responsible for
                    drawing up the legal acts for the establishment of the Banate of Slovenia was
                    appointed with the government on 14 September 1939. On this basis the Ban's
                    Administration of the Drava Banate prepared the texts of all sorts of decrees:
                    about the establishment of the Slovenian Banate; organisation of Ban's
                    Administration and Banate Assembly as the Slovenian parliamentary
                    representation; elections for the Banate Assembly and its rules of procedure;
                    administrative court for Slovenia; and about the Banate budget. Proposals were
                    also prepared with regard to transferring the matters from the individual
                    ministries to the offices in Ljubljana. In 1940 the former SLS minister,
                        <persName ref="#pers-GosarAndrej">Dr. Andrej Gosar</persName>, published his
                    study The Banate of Slovenia in a special publication, substantiating numerous
                    state-legal, economic and financial reasons for the formation of the Slovenian
                    Banate. The preparations for the establishment of the Banate of Slovenia then
                    came to a halt due to the looming danger of war. Thus the Ban's Council no
                    longer discussed the establishment of the Slovenian Banate at its final session
                    in February 1941.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn232" n="229">

                    However, if we analyse the relationship between Slovenians and Yugoslavia
                    between 1918 and 1941 thoroughly, we can emphasise that the negative Slovenian
                    experiences with it were offset by certain favourable characteristics and
                    achievements of the Slovenian development in this state community. As it was,
                    apart from the progress in the national-cultural, educational, economic and
                    political area the so-called silent autonomy proved that Slovenians were capable
                    of managing and pursuing their national, cultural, economic as well as political
                    life on their own, autonomously. This strengthened Slovenians in their
                    conviction that their majority national autonomist-federalist goals were
                    well-founded, which in turn strengthened the Slovenian national awareness and
                    self-confidence as well as represented a national-political background for them
                    to carry on from the Kingdom of SHS/Yugoslavia and apply in the subsequent
                    historical developments.</p>

                    <p xml:id="p-90">The date was picked with great care. On Friday, 14 January
                        1921, a "veritable spring sun" was shining upon the Yugoslav capital of
                        Belgrade, despite the winter season. But more importantly, the citizens were
                        celebrating the Orthodox New Year, so the streets were full of hustle and
                        bustle. On that Friday, buildings had been decked out with flags since the
                        morning, and the old royal palace and the streets were lined with soldiers,
                        with curious and festive masses gathering behind them. Many people wanted to
                        see what was about to happen with their own eyes, many wanted to be there,
                        to participate in a political event reaching beyond the everyday
                        understanding of politics. For what was announced for the 14 January was no
                        party-related political curiosity but rather something that would be, or was
                        at least supposed to be, of extreme importance for the country and its
                        citizens. In the recently converted cavalry barracks, Regent <persName
                            ref="#pers-KarađorđevićAleksander">Alexander Karađorđević</persName>
                        opened the session of the Constituent Assembly of the Kingdom of Serbs,
                        Croats and Slovenes, the first elected national parliament.</p>
                    <p xml:id="p-91">The scenario for the ceremonious opening session was elaborated
                        to great detail. At 10.45, Alexander, who was dressed in his formal
                        general's uniform, joined Prime Minister <persName ref="#pers-PašićNikola"
                            >Nikola Pašić</persName>, boarded a quadriga and headed off towards the
                        parliament. In front of the building, Alexander was greeted by the royal
                        marching band that played all three national anthems, i.e. the Serbian,
                        Croatian and Slovenian, after which he was received, still in front of the
                        building, by the Presidency members headed by <persName

                        immediately stood up and gave a standing ovation, cannon fire thundered off
                        the fortress, and bells of the Belgrade churches started ringing. The
                        setting was truly amazing. The Regent then brought out the text of his
                        speech and took about fifteen minutes to read it with a "firm voice" to the
                        excited audience who often interrupted with thunderous applause and cheers.
                        Alexander's speech was inspiring and statesmanlike.<note place="foot"

                        bursting with excitement. Alexander left slowly, shaking <persName
                            ref="#pers-RibarIvan">Ribar's</persName> hand again as they parted. He
                        boarded his chariot right before Prime Minister <persName
                            ref="#pers-PašićNikola">Pašić</persName>. However, at the moment when
                        the old Prime Minister sat down, a curious incident occurred, which involved
                        a rather charming faux pas in the protocol. <persName
                            ref="#pers-PašićNikola">Pašić</persName> noticed he was missing his top
                        hat. He was immediately rescued from the awkward situation by President of
                        the Parliament <persName ref="#pers-RibarIvan">Ribar</persName>, who gave
                        him his own. Alexander, who noticed the mishap, just smiled and said: "Look,
                        there is <persName ref="#pers-PašićNikola">Pašić</persName> under <persName
                            ref="#pers-RibarIvan">Ribar's</persName> hat!" One of the Assembly
                        representatives, who happened to be there, added: "It's a symbolic
                        reflection of today's political situation!"<note place="foot"

                        coming to the forefront, becoming a central political body that would use a
                        guided democratic debate to make key political decisions, supervise
                        ministers and gradually build a strong country in the Balkans.</p>
                    <p xml:id="p-93">However, the symbolic position of the Parliament, as it
                        appeared when <persName ref="#pers-PašićNikola">Pašić</persName> boarded the
                        quadriga in 1921, was only momentary and merely symbolic. Soon enough, both
                        the people as well as some politicians started to notice that the parliament
                        was not performing its intended function, that it failed to function
                        properly, and that it became a rather big disappointment. As had happened
                        many times before and also at that time, and as it would happen time and
                        time again in the future, most political parties and the people, who wanted
                            <hi rend="italic">political democracy</hi>, were left unhappy with its

                        Belgrade Assembly as nothing less than an "unintelligent and wholly
                        primitive negation of even the most rudimentary parliamentary form".<note

                        noticed, the Assembly was becoming increasingly similar to a

                    <p xml:id="p-94">Among the many reasons for disappointment with the Yugoslav
                        parliamentary democracy, the events occurring at the Assembly Hall during
                        parliamentary debates were not at all insignificant. Besides voting, a
                        parliamentary debate was the central characteristic and distinctive feature
                        of any parliament, not just the one in Belgrade. The debate at that time
                        included bursts of heated interpersonal exchanges, including physical
                        confrontations, supported by various arguments and illustrated by cases etc.
                        The dry legislation proposals, formerly empty of anything redundant, now
                        suddenly became the subject of extensive explanations and the catalyst of
                        political passions. As such, the debate was a reflection of the parliament
                        as a whole and represents the point we can use to evaluate the perception of
                        problems in the country and general democratic standards.</p>
                    <p xml:id="p-95">The content and spirit of the Rules of Procedure of the debate
                        in Belgrade were modern and practical, but, first and foremost, they were
                        wholly comparable to the rules of procedure and other arrangements in
                        numerous other European parliaments. Speakers had to take turns in the
                        sequence of standpoints for – against – for – against etc., and had to limit
                        the duration of their speeches (to a rather generous one hour and a half for
                        parliamentary group leaders and one hour for other representatives during
                        the discussion of principles, and to an hour for group leaders and 30
                        minutes for representatives in the special debate), but most of all they had
                        to be careful to strictly stick to the topic of the agenda item under
                        discussion. They had to memorize the text and then speak. The Rules of
                        Procedure also explicitly specified that a discussion of anybody's private
                        matters was off limits.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn240" n="237">

                        the agenda, talked about anything they wanted to and sometimes read their
                            speeches.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn241" n="238">

                            in March 1931, the assembly lashed out with cries that no one is
                            "allowed to read". The representative apologized saying he was merely
                            using the notes "for his own reference". – <bibl>

                        the most problematic issue. The parliament was the venue of events that
                        brought about much more aggravation. In the following section, I will look
                        at some of the key characteristics of the parliament and a few typical
                        stories of what went on in the Assembly Hall. The focus will be on
                        illustrating the general mood as well as the practices of the

                        critical but also the most practical and problem-focused were the ones
                        concerning the state budget. Discussions about the budget were carried out
                        by individual particulars (items), meaning that the opposition was able to
                        scrutinize the work of every minister individually.<note place="foot"

                            66</bibl>.</note> Debates on the budgetary exposés of the ministers were
                        often reminiscent of interpellations as opposition representatives pointed
                        out problems in individual sectors, documented errors, identified corruption
                        etc., naturally blaming everything on the politically responsible minister
                        or even the whole government. Representatives always took their time to
                        debate, usually all of the time provided for by the Rules of Procedure, i.e.
                        two months. The budgets, although frequently unrealized and planned for a
                        utopian economic situation, were also among the most important political
                        documents regularly adopted by the Assembly. In addition to the very
                        gradually developing Yugoslav legislation, these documents made sure the
                        country was able to function at least to a certain degree.</p>
                    <p xml:id="p-97">The budget was always accompanied by what was called the
                        financial act. This was a sort of a collection of figures and various
                        ministerial decisions, government decrees and other instruments that needed
                        to be covered by the budget. From 1922 onward, i.e. from the first budgetary
                        debate after the adoption of the constitution, the financial act was known
                        by a humorous moniker – it was called the omnibus. The term was used to
                        convey that the financial act was "jumped on" by numerous individuals who
                        added their own interests to the needs of the country. The financial act was
                        so chaotic that it was frequently unclear even to the ministers, who were
                        thus unable to answer specific questions posed to them in the parliament.
                        The true "masters" of the financial act were senior officials, heads of
                        various public and private offices etc. For a little counter favour, they
                        were able to include (almost) anything into the financial act. It is true,
                        however, that some cases of absurd protectionism were often exposed, usually
                        those that involved ministers or representatives. A well-known
                        representative of the Serbian National Radical Party <persName
                            ref="#pers-JankovićStevan">Stevan Janković</persName> was able to sneak
                        in an interpretation according to which the high school of forestry in the

                        extensive and that the debate was difficult, heated and strenuous is
                        attested by a detail from the first budgetary session of 1922. It was
                        Saturday, just after eight in the evening, when the agenda indicated that
                        the debate should now focus on the Ministry of Postal Services. According to
                        Assembly President <persName ref="#pers-RibarIvan">Ivan Ribar</persName>,
                        Minister <persName ref="#pers-MiladinovićŽarko">Žarko Miladinović</persName>
                        had been very serious in preparing his exposé. His presentation was supposed
                        to take two hours. However, the previous items of the budget had drained the
                        representatives, they were exhausted and had had enough of debates. On a
                        Saturday evening, they just wanted to go home. But the item could not be
                        postponed as the budget was overdue. <persName ref="#pers-BarićStjepan"

                        telephone and telegraph services were in such "total disarray" that it was
                        better not to speak about them or else the discussion would have lasted for
                        weeks. In protest against the state supported by the Minister, the
                        opposition said it was leaving the session. They glanced at the Minister and
                        went home.</p>

                        in the hall. They looked at each other, glanced enviously at the empty seats
                        of the opposition and then charged at the Minister. "Don't speak if there's
                        no opposition representatives present," they called out to him, and by that
                        point the troubled Minister did not dare to get up and have a speech. None
                        of the other representatives discussed anything either. The discussion was
                        thus over and the only thing left to do was to vote. Enough representatives
                        of the majority were present, and so the budget of the Ministry of Postal
                        Services was voted through.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn245" n="242">

                        exposed the Yugoslav society and its problems, pointed out mistakes and
                        showcased the country's inability to face its problems. In this sense, the
                        debate was certainly relevant as it articulated the heartbeat of the
                        "nation". However, speakers often broke the rules of decorum, insulted other
                        representatives and acted in a destructive or even violent manner. The
                        inability of achieving a fundamental political consensus did not manifest
                        itself in gentlemanly parliamentary banter typical of the halls of
                        Westminster Palace, but rather in intolerant slander and open intimidation.
                        The key problem of the Yugoslav Parliament was not the debate as a whole,
                        and not even moments of commotions and bouts of yelling, but the <hi

                        parliament witnessed the utterance of "unparliamentary expressions": words
                        that were either insulting or generally inappropriate (or labelled as such

                        parliamentarism; some of the terms were more popular and had been used more
                        than once. The representatives insulted each other with the following
                        expressions: "You're a deadbeat", "shameless", "nincompoop", "layabouts",
                        "traitor", "good-for-nothing", "crook", "scoundrel", "lowlife". Sometimes,
                        the insult was coated in a pre-emptive apology: "You're a parliamentary,
                        please excuse my French, idiot." The assembly itself was called the "tower
                        of Babel" and the country a "police state". Words deriving from the root "to
                        lie" were particularly popular, i.e. "you're lying", "liar", "you lie", as
                        were also the words "bandit" and "criminal". Catholic representatives were
                        often called "clericals" by their opponents, and Catholic priests were
                        called "monks". Some statements were openly threatening, such as "I'll spill
                        your guts out", "you old bitch", some were jokingly insulting, such as "A
                        man who's a few screws short of a hardware store shouldn't speak!" and
                        "You're one of the worst and laziest members of the parliament!", while some
                        bordering the grotesque, such as one representative's scoff against another:
                        "You used to be a cook!" Although true, it was considered unparliamentary to
                        mention the private lives of representatives in the parliamentary

                        pandemonium raged at the benches. The tireless and precise assembly

                            took place the likes of which the South Slavic world had never seen
                            before; a scandal that occurred nowhere else than in the parliament. Not

                            assembly and its work, even foreign correspondents noted that something
                            truly remarkable had happened. The 25 February issue of the eminent

                            published the story on its cover as well. "Eine beispiellose Szene in

                            script, and continued: "Denn alle Beispiele solcher Entblössungen aus

                            The moral framework, as much as it still existed in politics and in the
                            society, was damaged. A naked man had appeared in the parliament; a nude
                            body was displayed.</p>
                        <p xml:id="p-108">The detailed press reports offer the same facts, diverging
                            to a certain degree when it comes to the details, key points and
                            exaggerations while leaving the basic structure of the story intact. The
                            genesis of the scandal was wholly spontaneous. On that day, the Assembly
                            was discussing the interpellation of Minister of Internal Affairs
                                <persName ref="#pers-MaksimovićBožo">Božo Maksimović</persName>, who
                            was also called Kundak (butt of a rifle). Numerous witnesses of
                            encounters with <persName ref="#pers-MaksimovićBožo"
                                >Maksimović's</persName> police indicated that the moniker was quite
                            fitting. The police violence was also one of the focal points of the
                            interpellation. Since there was great interest in the session, the
                            representatives' benches were packed, as were the galleries and
                            diplomatic seats. There was no shortage of well-dressed ladies (their
                            reactions to the incident later became the subject of numerous risqué
                            but mostly fictitious anecdotes).</p>
                        <p xml:id="p-109">From the very beginning, the atmosphere was tense. Verbal
                            interruptions and provocations occurred throughout the entire reading of
                            the interpellation and one minor commotion broke out. As Minister
                                <persName ref="#pers-MaksimovićBožo">Maksimović</persName> stepped
                            to the podium and presented his reply, however, the hubbub was
                            transferred to the hallways of the Assembly. A loud altercation was
                            echoing through the corridors, and suddenly the developments in the hall
                            were no longer interesting. Everybody looked towards the door as it flew
                            open. In the narrow space, they were able to see opposition
                            representatives, including two former ministers, pushing through and
                            yelling "Shame!", "Terrible!" and "Down with the government!". They were
                            carrying a man, terribly beaten up and bleeding. Somewhere in the
                            distant, absent background, President of the Assembly <persName
                                ref="#pers-TrifkovićMarko">Marko Trifković</persName> was yelling,
                            "Order, gentlemen! This is the Assembly," but nobody heard him. With
                            their mouths open, everybody watched the unprecedented scene that
                            unfolded in the next few moments. A confused man appeared in the middle
                            of the Assembly Hall, with his head bent down and his clothes all torn.
                            The opposition representatives who had carried him inside took off his
                            clothes in front of everyone, lifted the man up and carried him towards
                            the benches of the coalition. The image of the bleeding body mixed with
                            hysterical screams from the galleries was drowning in the all-enveloping
                            commotion. Every now and then, one could hear the opposition: "This is
                            your doing! Here's your proof for the allegations!"</p>
                        <p xml:id="p-110">The beaten man was <persName ref="#pers-RistićJovan">Jovan

                            with a friend in a café and accidentally crossed paths with <persName

                            the notorious Commissar of the Topčider Police. After a brief verbal
                            duel, <persName ref="#pers-SokolovićCommissaroftheTopčider"
                                >Sokolović</persName> took him away and beat him up. The following
                            morning, representatives of the opposition found out about the incident
                            and managed to get <persName ref="#pers-RistićJovan">Ristić</persName>
                            out of prison. They immediately came up with the distasteful idea that
                            they had found the "corpus delicti" for their interpellation; the beaten
                                <persName ref="#pers-RistićJovan">Ristić</persName>, who was
                            reportedly bleeding from the nose and eyes, became a "living

                        <p xml:id="p-111">Although even the mildest of reporters wrote that the

                            also warned that blood did indeed flow under the current government. The

                            ended, and, in January 1929, King Alexander declared a personal
                            dictatorship.</p>

                            certain extent. He imposed a new constitution and reinstated the
                            parliament, but the latter operated more like a makeshift parliament. In
                            the early 1930s, the benches of the new, "post-dictatorial" assembly
                            which was, quite symbolically, housed in a different building, were
                            being warmed by carefully selected supporters of the King's regime. But
                            did it mean that they paid any more heed to the new procedural
                            provisions regarding order and discipline at the sessions? Initially,
                            there were virtually no incidents; the assembly mostly unanimously
                            cheered for King Alexander, welcomed the "Yugoslav unity" and encouraged
                            the already elated speakers with cries of "Hurrah!". It was common to
                            hear "protracted approval and frantic applause".<note place="foot"

                                >Pavlič</persName> started one of his speeches in a very populist
                            manner: "Not a single government on this Earth except for ours, except
                            for our poor Kingdom of Yugoslavia, has ministers without portfolios. So
                            I ask of the ministers without portfolios, appealing to their patriotic
                            sentiment, to submit their resignation to the ministry without
                            portfolio, so that the money otherwise spent on them might go to the
                            hungry and unemployed." This was during the great economic crisis.

                                >Pavlič</persName> continued: "The intelligentsia, workers and

                            about issues that had nothing to do with the agenda. He was increasingly
                            grating on his colleagues' nerves. In November 1933, his speech was even
                            interrupted by calls and protests from his own people in the opposition.

                        <p xml:id="p-116">That year, i.e. 1933, would have been a very average one
                            in terms of disturbances in the Assembly, comparable to the years before
                            and after it, were it not for a tiny wintertime drama that was not at
                            all typical for the heated atmosphere of the Assembly. What occurred on
                            16 February seemed downright cheerful and mocking at the same time. The
                            commotion was incited by a controversial report submitted by the
                            committee that reviewed the proposed new municipalities act. The
                            protracted document thoroughly dissected the totally new conceptions of
                            the role and significance of municipalities: the composition of
                            municipal boards, responsibilities, conditions for their creation, land
                            consolidation – as well as suffrage. According to the proposal, voting
                            at the municipal elections would be open to all residents on the
                            electoral roll, as said by <persName ref="#pers-StojadinovićMiloslav"
                                >Miloslav Stojadinović</persName>, which was an ordinary statement,
                            but with a charged continuation. <persName
                                ref="#pers-StojadinovićMiloslav">Stojadinović</persName> went on to
                            add: "Gentlemen, the general tendency within the committee seemed to be
                            that women should receive the right to vote as well." Calls of "By God!"
                            immediately resounded and intensified into a torrent of yelling,
                            comments etc. The chairman had to admonish the representatives not to
                            disturb the speaker. <persName ref="#pers-StojadinovićMiloslav"
                                >Stojadinović</persName> then calmly and eagerly explained the idea:
                            "I know that discussions of this type tend to provoke both dispositions
                            and indispositions. Such is the very nature of the matter." He reminded
                            his colleagues that women's suffrage would be constitutional as the
                            imposed constitution provided that women's suffrage would be determined
                            by a separate act, and pointed out that many "cultural and national"
                            aspects spoke in its favour. <persName ref="#pers-StojadinovićMiloslav"
                                >Stojadinović</persName> talked about equality, mentioned some
                            possible compromise solutions (to enfranchise only a limited number of
                            women in independent professions), but all he got in return were verbal
                            interruptions and noise. Representative <persName

                            "Women have more courage than people!" and mirthful laughter resounded
                            in the hall.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn262" n="259">

                            dead horse. This is the reason why disciplinary norms, along with
                            sanctions that the Assembly had prescribed for itself in order to
                            preserve its reputation and ensure effective procedure, were so much

                            (Quite unusual for the head of the leading Slovenian party?!) According
                            to <persName ref="#pers-KorošecAnton">Korošec</persName>, the problem
                            was causing people to become increasingly apathetic. Furthermore, the
                            parliament was hardly dealing with legislation at that point. "The main
                            function of the representatives is no longer to legislate and control
                            the administration but rather to intervene and write endless letters in
                            response to requests for interventions. Nowadays, a conscientious
                            representative will waste his day intervening at various ministries and,
                            without exaggeration, he would need a dedicated secretary for all his
                            correspondence." Therefore: parliamentarism is in crisis due to their

                            could be drawn regarding the time of the first Yugoslavia. The
                            constitutionally mandated system (the norm) was exemplary, at least in
                            the first decade; however, the parliamentary form was compromised by
                            parliamentary practice. In public, representatives were usually merely

                    established, the Marxist ideological‑political camp in Slovenia was represented
                    by the Yugoslav Social Democratic Party (hereinafter the JSDS). The JSDS joined
                    the new state community with modern and mostly democratic programme
                    orientations, formed already in the Austrian period. Like other social
                    democratic parties around Europe it represented especially the interests of the
                    working class with the goal of asserting the social rights and protection of
                    workers from ruthless exploitation. It argued for the democratisation of the
                    political system and for the political cohabitation of all citizens, as
                    substantiated with the universal suffrage. In this regard it emphasised that the
                    workers' movement could attain its goals in an evolutionary manner, with gradual
                    reforms as well as legal and parliamentary means of the struggle for power in
                    the context of the bourgeois democracy. In its opinion democracy had an evident

                    and revolutionary (communist) part. The orientation of the new party, the
                    Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) with Slovenian communists as its integral
                    part, was determined by the Comintern guidelines. Immediately after the war as

                    political transformation, stemming from the criticism of the existing capitalist
                    system. Their immediate demands and goals were identical in many aspects.
                    However, they differed significantly with regard to the path towards the
                    realisation of the socio-political programme. This difference had a decisive
                    impact on their outlook on the question of democracy and defined their positions
                    in the socio-political space, since the willingness to cohabitate differed
                    radically between these parties. The social democrats kept insisting that
                    reforms leading to social changes should be undertaken in a parliamentary
                    manner, in the context of the plural bourgeois democracy. Until the autumn of
                    1919 the JSDS also cooperated with the Catholic and Liberal Party in the

                    and political option. This already in its essence excluded parliamentarism and
                    the possibility for cohabitation in general. On the other hand, the social
                    democratic understanding of socialism did not reject the modern social
                    institutions and achievements like parliamentarism and multi-party system, human
                    rights and freedoms, market economy, rule of law, etc. Social democrats saw all
                    of these suppositions of the modern society as indispensable in their
                    perceptions of a socially just state.</p>

                        >Demokracija ali diktatura (Democracy or Dictatorship)</hi>, <persName
                        ref="#pers-PrepeluhAlbin">Prepeluh</persName> described the theoretical
                    framework of his understanding of democracy and the related democratic nature of
                    the state. In his analyses he established empirically that every class, once it
                    attains the political power, "uses democracy for its own advantage, furthering
                    its social agenda". Thus every democratic rule has its social contents. However,
                    in democratic politics, in which all of the social strata participate, these
                    contents are confirmed at democratic elections, where the majority decides.
                    Therefore the nature of democracy may be bourgeois democratic, peasant
                    democratic, or proletarian (socialist) democratic. We cannot only speak about
                    democracy in the presence of harmony between the social and administrative or
                    state power. Democratic states should rely exclusively on the existing social
                    forces, and any violent redistribution of the state power, for example by means
                    of the military, is unacceptable. If conflicts in the relationship between the
                    state and society are obvious, we can only talk about a dictatorship. <persName
                        ref="#pers-PrepeluhAlbin">Prepeluh</persName> emphasised that Marxist
                    socialism had always sought the support of democracy, that it wanted to take
                    over the power only democratically, which is why the socialist parties
                    endeavoured for universal suffrage and ascribed such a profound importance to
                    the elections for the legislative and administrative corporations. He talked
                    about the "dictatorship of democracy", which was what the socialist parties
                    aspired to, but which was also substantially different from the Bolshevik
                    dictatorship, "which may well call itself the dictatorship of the proletariat,
                    but that does not make it true". He described the Russian system at the time as
                    "despotic socialism", supported by a strong army but lacking the economic
                    preconditions, which is why Russia had succumbed to a profound material
                    poverty.</p>

                        Women)</hi>, outlining the women's movement programme. She believed that the
                    times were too serious to keep leaving women on the side-lines, and that they
                    had to be stirred awake from apathy and encouraged to assert their political
                    equality as one of the demands of the democratic age. In her opinion it was also
                    necessary to overcome the belief that the merit of such demands, expressed by
                    women, was "very problematic". However, she saw women in the political arena
                    differently from men. According to <persName ref="#pers-ŠtebiAlojzija">Alojzija
                        Štebi</persName>, women should focus on the field of activities that
                    "corresponded most to their most natural calling – motherhood". In the time
                    after the war women should especially become active in social matters, where
                    they should replace the humiliating charity practices. Because of their maternal
                    instincts they would, supposedly, successfully carry out a variety of tasks in
                    the establishment of public life, participate in the state and municipal
                    legislation and administration, all of this with the goal of strengthening the
                    morality and enriching the life of the whole community. <persName
                        ref="#pers-ŠtebiAlojzija">Štebi</persName> also believed that with their
                    civil rights women would be able to remove the principle of force from the
                    relationship between the nations, as this was supposedly still a heritage from
                    the barbaric past. With this deepened insight into motherhood in its individual
                    and social implications, the democratic society would supposedly ensure that its
                    offspring would be able to apply the right to freedom properly and would not
                    shirk the duties involved in this freedom.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn292"

                    in the committee for the preparation of the constitution in February 1921, when
                    the socialist parliamentary group presented its plan of the constitution as an
                    alternative to the government proposal. On this occasion <persName

                    parliamentary group had not prepared a so-called socialist constitution, because
                    in view of the political division of power such a constitution would not have
                    had any chance of being adopted. Therefore the constitutional plan allegedly
                    only included the proposals which were more widely acceptable for all the groups
                    aware of the social questions, which had to be addressed systematically, not by

                    social order would sooner or later follow the existing capitalist system, but
                    that the socialists took into account the realistic circumstances in which they
                    did not have the majority for the implementation of their ideas, while they
                    refused to support violent implementation. He emphasised that the working class
                    would be victorious only when it was numerous enough and thus in the majority,
                    which could only be achieved if tolerance prevailed within the working class
                    itself. The latter was, obviously, aimed against the communists and commented on
                    the differences in the methods of activities, which had divided the working
                    class.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-133">The socialist constitutional plan called upon the implementation

                    constitutional resolution of the issues involving the most neglected strata.
                    This was disputed intensely by the communist deputies, as such a plan was, in
                    their opinion, in the interest of the bourgeoisie.<note place="foot"

                    was based on the standpoint that the authority stemmed from the people, which
                    implied a republican form of government in which the bourgeois parties would
                    participate as well, therefore this would not yet be a socialist government. As
                    far as the monarchy was concerned, the socialists opposed it in principle, not
                    in order to oppose the concrete <persName ref="#pers-Karadjordjevići"

                    could represent the foundations for the government in any democratic state in
                    the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century, and that the state had to be
                    sovereign in all its aspects. According to the socialists a state was not
                    sovereign if it had to, for example, share the power with an organisation which
                    was "not of this world", that is, with the Church; especially if multiple
                    religions existed in the said state. They argued for the separation of the state
                    from all the churches and supported the freedom of religion and conviction. The
                    separation should also include schools, because it could not be in the interest
                    of the state to bring up Orthodox, Catholic or Muslim citizens, and so on.
                    Instead it should be interested in educating free citizens, while tolerating all
                    religions. They also rejected any participation of the churches in the

                <p xml:id="p-134">Apart from the aforementioned demands the socialists also
                    emphasised that the most vital part of the constitution was the one regulating
                    the economic and social fields, and underlined that the state should be an
                    organisation of all of its citizens rather than a protector of any of the
                    individual classes. In their opinion, the efforts should proceed in the
                    direction of reducing the class discord by gradually ensuring equal rights in
                    the economic and social field, namely, organising the society in such a manner
                    that the interests of the people should always come first. <persName

                    it could only play such a role if a suitable electoral system, encompassing the
                    widest strata of the people regardless of gender, was implemented. They rejected
                    the argument that women should not have the right to vote, because in case of
                    their participation in the election the results would be more "reactionary" than

                    women's right to vote the social democrats established that as a parliamentary
                    minority they had no possibility of influencing the adoption of the legislation.
                    They were also disappointed because most of their proposals were rejected.<note

                    by the results of the elections for the Constitutional Assembly of November 1920
                    when they became the third strongest party, and their encouragement of
                    revolutionary conditions shook the very foundations of the existing social
                    system. For this reason the government adopted certain measures in order to
                    prevent the political activities of the communists. With the Obznana
                    (Announcement), published on 30 December 1920, the government prohibited any
                    communist activities (with the exception of the communist deputies) during the
                    session of the Constitutional Assembly and until the adoption of the

                    language; the urgency of the struggle for the "final and ultimate victory of the
                    proletariat" was emphasised; claims were made that "neither in the Parliament
                    nor in the municipalities could the working and peasant people look for their
                    solutions"; it was openly stated that the communists only took part in the
                    municipal elections in order to make sure that the proletariat could "stir up a

                    controversial position in the 1920s. It intended to consolidate its power and
                    importance with its integration in an all-Yugoslav workers' party, which it
                    carried out in the end of 1921 with the accession to the Socialist Party of
                    Yugoslavia (SSJ). Thus it became the regional organisation of the SSJ for
                    Slovenia, while on the other hand it split into several fractions in 1922 and
                    1923, which weakened its influence. If the social democrats received seven
                    deputy mandates at the elections for the Constitutional Assembly in November
                    1920, they appeared at the National Assembly elections in March 1923 divided
                    into four groups. As expected, they ended up without any mandates.<note

                    the SSJ also demanded the implementation of socialism and thus a classless
                    society in a peaceful manner. However, it underlined the conviction that the
                    socialist idea could only be fully asserted if it managed to spread among the
                    industrial workers, tradesmen and peasants, while the intellectuals and
                    technical intelligentsia would also have to be convinced in order to introduce
                    socialism. The permanent preservation of socialism could only be ensured in this

                    between the communists and socialists, they were also capable of joint or even
                    wider actions. Thus a resounding joint appearance of communists, Christian
                    socialists and the Ljubljana fraction of the SSJ (the so-called Zarjani) in the
                    context of the Alliance of the Working People (ZDL) took place at the Ljubljana
                    municipal elections in December 1922, with the aim of preventing the victory of
                    the liberals. In its pre-election appearances the ZDL demanded the
                    implementation of the widest possible self-management of the municipalities,
                    abolishment of the State Protection Act, freedom of association, assurance of

                    liberals against the "immoral" association in Ljubljana, the Workers' List won
                    with a significant majority. In the beginning of 1923 the communists and the
                    so-called Zarjani even established a separate Socialist Party of the Working

                    and nations oppressed by the Greater Serbian hegemony. It was unrealistic in its
                    expectations that it would successfully organise the socially and nationally
                    neglected strata into a united front "from below" and instigate a decisive
                    action against the dictatorship regime with mottos like: "Land to hardworking
                    peasants!", "Against war!", "For the alliance with the Soviet Russia!", "For the
                    dictatorship of workers and peasants!", and "For the free union of worker and

                    the standpoint of the KPJ with regard to the inefficiency of the bourgeois

                    dictatorship would only deepen the pressing social and national issues, but it
                    also saw the possibility for a revolutionary solution of social problems: the
                    replacement of the military-fascist dictatorship with the dictatorship of

                    However, the efforts to organise an armed uprising and bring down the monarchy
                    as an imperialist structure remained at the level of revolutionary rhetoric, as
                    the communist resistance mostly consisted of propaganda in the form of
                    disseminating flyers – only in Ljubljana seventeen extensive actions of this
                    kind were detected by the police in 1929. The sectarian orientation of what had
                    already been a weak and insignificant party isolated the communists even further
                    and exposed them to severe repression of the authorities.<note place="foot"

                    methods of the Party operations: at that time the Communist Party in Slovenia
                    started gradually focusing on mass activities in the context of legal
                    possibilities. The move towards the new orientation was reflected in the
                    abandonment of the directive on the formation of illegal Party trade unions;
                    discarding of the unappeasable attitude towards the social democratic workers

                    alliance with the peasants and the middle-class bourgeoisie with the assistance
                    of the Slovenian National Revolutionaries organisation. The communists wanted to
                    overcome their social isolation with the public declarations with regard to the
                    boycott of the 1933 municipal elections, participation in the workers chamber

                    small peasants and other weaker strata, while they addressed the widest public
                    by emphasising anti-fascism and thus also attracting a part of the
                    intelligentsia. With such political reorientation and with the appeals to
                    democracy, simultaneously exhibiting the zeal so characteristic for the
                    communists and taking advantage of various legal and semi-legal methods of

                    provincial conference in Goričane in September 1934. Thus the Party tried to
                    persuade especially the peasants as the allies of the revolution. It rejected
                    the opinion that as an internationalist workers' party it was not concerned with
                    the resolution of the national question. Instead it started to see this issue as

                    of the revolutionary struggle of the communists was also reflected in the
                    decision of the Comintern that the Communist Parties of Slovenia and Croatia
                    should be established in the context of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. The
                    goal of this reorganisation was to ensure a more effective political
                    participation of the oppressed nations' communist parties as national parties in
                    the sense of a counterbalance to other national parties. In this regard it was
                    also explicitly underlined that the internal organisational structure of the
                    united KPJ would not change in any sense, and that it would still be based on
                    its centralist foundations. The decision on the establishment of the Communist
                    Party of Slovenia (KPS) was then adopted at the fourth state conference of the
                    KPJ in December 1934, but it was not implemented until more than two years
                        later.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn331" n="328">

                    thus undermining the unity of the oppressed Yugoslav nations in their struggle
                    against the Greater Serbian domination, centralism and terror, while exposing
                    the Slovenian nation to the danger of "being left completely alone in its
                    struggle for the national survival". It demanded the introduction of democratic
                    freedoms, abolishment of the January 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> regime,
                    termination of the economic exploitation of the Slovenian nation by the Greater
                    Serbian centralism, as well as the convening of a democratically-elected
                    Constitutional Assembly and Slovenian Parliament as a representative of the
                    sovereignty of the Slovenian nation. It also called for a united and free
                    Slovenia in a community of equal Yugoslav nations in the context of a federal
                    state. The scope of the People's Front orientation is emphasised especially in
                    the demand for the crucial "unification of all democratic political powers that
                    care about the fate of the Slovenian nation", and in this regard the communists
                    guaranteed that democracy and freedom of world view would be respected.<note

                    them of spreading "disgusting" propaganda against the Soviet Union. The
                    conference expressed its distrust of all bourgeois and petty bourgeois parties,
                    called for a consistent alignment with the Soviet Union, and expressed its
                    conviction that a swift revolutionary momentum would be achieved. At the same

                    ambivalent, as in its attitude to the other political subjects the Party acted

                    strengthen its influence in the months preceding the war. This was expressed in

                    anti-inflation demonstrations, collection of signatures for the establishment of

                        declaring that Yugoslavia would be a federal country was adopted on the
                        basis of the formal and legal right of nations to self-determination. In its
                        plans for the post-war period, the resistance movement thus officially and
                        formally abolished the pre-war centralist and unitarist system of
                        government.</p>

                        straightforward, but went through a number of contradictory phases that
                        depended on various factors. In this context, the attitude of the Slovenian
                        resistance towards Yugoslavia varied as well, but the resistance always
                        remained part of the Yugoslav movement led by <persName

                        main adversary, we did not emphasize Yugoslavia much as it was the main
                        rallying cry of these reactionary elements. We mainly focused on the
                        self-determination of the Slovenian nation and especially its right of
                        secession. With this slogan, we destroyed the <persName
                            ref="#pers-MihailovićDragoljubDraža">Mihailović</persName> reaction and
                        won the masses to our side. The situation after the Italian offensive was
                        different. At that time, Mihajlović's supporters embarked on a path of open
                        treason. Our course was to win over the centre. This prompted us to change
                        tactics and put the Yugoslav question on the agenda. This tactic allowed us
                        to win over part of the centre and neutralize the rest. Our tactics always
                        followed the needs dictated by the overall development. Therefore, we
                        sometimes focused on secession and at other times we emphasized

                        as the occupying forces, considered national enemies at the time. CK KPS
                        issued a special communiqué in February 1942, renouncing these allegations

                        past political and national form and because they only see Yugoslavia as
                        themselves. Their selfish reasons thus lead them to opt for the past form of

                        deciding on a new, revolutionary course that alone holds the promise of
                        liberation for both Slovenians and Yugoslavia. However, while their opinion

                        dissolution was precisely the Greater Serbian face of legitimacy. They
                        conveniently forget that the hearts of patriotic Yugoslavs have by now been
                        filled with the idea of a new Yugoslavia, cleansed of political and social

                        Socialist Republics in June 1942 that had a significant impact on the new
                        views of the liberation movement regarding future international and domestic
                        situation, the Executive Committee of the Liberation Front issued a special
                        pronouncement stressing that the signature marked "the first agreement
                        between two superpowers that elevates the principle of self-determination of
                        nations to the position of the leading principle for future international
                        relations". The "Anglo-Soviet agreement thus represented the ultimate
                        international affirmation of the policies of the Liberation Front". The text
                        continued: "They are telling you that the Liberation Front is against
                        Yugoslavia, against Serbs and Croats. But in truth, the Liberation Front has
                        always emphasized the need for fellowship and unity of Yugoslav nations as
                        the unconditional principle of the common liberation struggle. The Front has
                        stressed countless times that the Southern Slavic nations are bound by the
                        same fate and that the organization thus believes that future national

                        form of a united country made up of these nations. Self-determination of the
                        Slovenian nation is not contrary to a united country of Southern Slavs;

                        as an independent nation, taking on the responsibilities as an equal

                        mean a renouncement of Yugoslavia in general. On the contrary, the struggle
                        for self-determination and its realization is the only way of bringing our
                        nation together with the Croats and the Serbs that could join them into a

                        clear and straightforward answers to a whole series of questions in which
                        the petite bourgeoisie of Ljubljana is particularly intolerant, despite
                        being able and obliged to do so. Our adversaries exploited our evasion and
                        tried to cast everything in such light as to imply that we have tricks up
                        our sleeves regarding these issues and do not want to show our true colours.
                        We should not delude ourselves that they won over some of the undecided
                        people exactly by doing this. One of such issues that we have danced around
                        is the question of Yugoslavia. We had often wrote about Yugoslavia as a dead
                        dog. We did issue a brochure – I do not know who wrote it – titled "The
                        Liberation Front and Yugoslavia" a little over half a year ago, but I must
                        say that the brochure did nothing to provide answers to the issue and was a
                        classic case of beating around the bush. All this drove away numerous honest
                        people for whom Yugoslavia remained a conditio sine qua non. I do not think
                        it would be a hyperbole to claim that SP has only recently, in the past few
                        months, began properly contrasting the old Yugoslavia and the new Yugoslavia

                        their claims on the fact that the LF has mercilessly exposed the faults of
                        the old Yugoslavia of Versailles. (…) However, is criticism of the old

                        community of brotherly nations – anti-Yugoslav? Today, the LF can proudly
                        announce that its Slovenian national programme was never opposed to the idea
                        of a Yugoslav community built on the basis of national equality and the
                        right of every nation to self-determination. And not only that! The LF may
                        claim to be the only Slovenian organization that provided a programme and
                        showed a practical way of how the Slovenian nation might achieve its
                        sovereign national rights and, at the same time, create favourable
                        conditions for the future symbiosis of Yugoslav nations, conditions for a

                        in Bihać) is important for us from a different perspective as well: The main
                        trump card of the reactionary elements has always been that we were
                        supposedly against Yugoslavia and in favour of some 'Central European Soviet
                        republic that would enslave our nation'. As stupid as the fabrication was,
                        it still held sway among the masses who hate Italy and Germany so much that
                        they no longer believe things would be better in a soviet state. We have
                        continually emphasized our position in favour of Yugoslavia. However, as we
                        never recognized the London government – at least not in practice – we could
                        offer no tangible proof of this. In fact, there was a widespread desire that
                        a unified political command would be established for the whole country,
                        which would, to a certain extent, already include elements of a new
                        government. Bihać had thus happened at exactly the right moment for

                        with increasing frequency in the Slovenian liberation press and was more and

                        evident from the principles of the resistance movement. At the same time,

                        future issues. On 4 December 1942, he therefore wrote to the Executive
                        Committee of the Liberation Front as follows: "With regard to internal and
                        external events, we will have to draft concrete proposals on what our future
                        Slovenia should look like. At the moment, we really have to write about the
                        future as much as possible. We will have to discuss the future in concrete
                        terms and prepare some organizational measures that would allow us to
                        realize these plans. The time has come when we will have to make plans and
                        communicate them to the masses! In my opinion, the central task in this
                        regard is for us to specify in detail our opinion of Yugoslavia, the London
                        government and the constitutional assembly in Bihać. (…) This is especially
                        important now, as the English were forced to use a radio broadcast to ask
                        all Yugoslavs to somehow let them know how they would want Yugoslavia to be

                        free and united Slovenia within the free and democratic Yugoslavia". The
                        assembly of representatives of the Slovenian nation, held from 1 to 3
                        October 1943 in the large liberated territory around Kočevje, was the
                        culmination of the Slovenian efforts for national emancipation during the

                    <p xml:id="p-174">"The Slovenes, and their struggle against the invader, were
                        something special. Yes there would have been no struggle if the leaders
                        hand't been convinced that they were bringing about a turning point in the
                        national destiny such as leaders before them had only dreamed of. In no
                        other Yugoslav land, among no other Yugoslav people, was there such keen
                        awareness, such enthusiasm over creation of one's own state. I myself first
                        became aware of this during the meeting of Slovenian representives which
                        began on. October 1 in Kočevje. This gathering was more impressive than all
                        the previous ones. The seting, the food, the decorations of the hall were

                        still more formidable one weren't on the way. Among the 562 representives
                        from all parts of Slovenia, the number who were prominent in their field or
                        occupation lent the session an extraordinarly historical significance.

                        adulated them; there was no presonality cult. The cult was Slovenia itself,
                        a unanimous surge toward statehood as the crowning fulfillment of
                        nationalism and the beginning of socialism. When <persName

                        that foreign rulers reffered to the Slovenes as a nation of servants, the
                        hall murmured in the anger, only to explode with rapture when he praised the
                        Partisans or spoke of a free Slovenia. Perhaps even more moving was the
                        delirious unanimity of the cities, and the soldieres with wounds still
                        fresh-all with their own litlte affairs, their own fears, yet fearless,
                        surging inevitabily toward a national and socail ideal. The speakers and all
                        present were caught up inn a moment of immortality. Above the podium was
                        emblazoned a quotation from Cankar, the Slovenian man of letters: "The
                        people shall write their own destiny." Cankar was written that before the

                        benign people following the downfall of bourgeois rule. There were veryn
                        few, if any, at that gathering who didn't know from their own experience
                        that people had to be led by an avant-garde to be a popular one, since the
                        people themselves were not conscious of their destiny, the ideal society.
                        The slogan: "The people shall write their own destiny" dazzled and
                        enthralled minds because it joined, indeed identified, the destiny of the
                        people with the role of the party; all that we Communists were doing was in
                        fact the destiny which the people were writing for themselves. And the
                        slogan was all the more enthralling and prophetic in that it sprang from
                        their own Slovenian socialist writer. The session was held at the night,
                        because of the danger of an atack from the air. The night, and the isolation
                        from the world outside, contributed to the self-containment of the gathering
                        and its surge toward a single aim and unquestioned unity. No one before us
                        Communists was ever so scientifically convinced that they were not only
                        transforming a given state of affairs, but giving men and nations an
                        ultimate and unalterable direction. All development and movement were seen
                        as the self-fulfillment of the ideology and the party. To be sure, the
                        course of life was not denied, but inasmuch as it was teleologically
                        understood, it had to be directed, constructed. What was left for
                        spontaneous, blind existence, but to submit to an omniscent and vital
                        conscieous? Our assemblies were even then unanimous, zealously obedient to
                        the leaders, with a sense of historic self-awareness. Yet the assembly at
                        Kočevje was the first to attain a total, conscious, and wanton fascination
                        with itself, with the ideas, battles, and leaders from which it
                            sprang."<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn387" n="384">

                        People in London keep saying: after the occupiers collapse, the Slovenian
                        nation will be free, but it is too early to put the federal issue on the
                        agenda. The workings of this federation, say the hypocrites in London, will
                        be discussed and decided after the war. What this post-war discussion would
                        look like is indicated by the fact that these reactionary gentlemen in
                        London were never to agree even among themselves. In this regard, we are not
                        going to tolerate any more doubts or beating around the bush. The Slovenian
                        nation joins the future Yugoslavia on its own accord, bolstered by its right
                        of self-determination. The federal system of the future Yugoslavia cannot be
                        in doubt any longer, nor can the fact that the Slovenian nation will be a
                        separate, self-governing federal unit in the future country. And if the
                        gentlemen in London remain doubtful about this, they should be told that we
                        have already settled this matter in a brotherly agreement with our brotherly
                        Yugoslav nations. Our activities are based on the principles of the right to

                        ("Učimo se pri južnih bratih!") published after the return of the Slovenian
                        delegation from Jajce: "At last let me speak about the genuine Yugoslav
                        spirit that is so strong in the South of the country. There is no doubt that
                        the dissolution in April and the incitement by national traitors had created
                        terrible chaos in the South, which threatened a slaughter between Serbs and
                        Croats that could have ended with their extinction. Today, the whole world
                        is in awe of the national liberation movement that managed to stop the chaos
                        and forged an unbreakable kinship and unity between Southern Slavic nations.
                        At this point, I want to emphasize the fact that has been the most pleasant
                        surprise of all, i.e. that the genuine Yugoslav spirit <hi rend="italic">has
                            penetrated the consciousness of the masses in all its detail</hi>. You
                        can hardly find a Serb who would blame Croats for the atrocities committed
                        by the Ustashe. You can hardly hear a chauvinist expression or profanity
                        aimed at a person of a different Souther Slavic nationality. However, there
                        is a strong will to learn everything and to personally apply everything good
                        that was created by other Southern Slavic nations. Despite doing our share
                        for the establishment of a new Yugoslavia and the fact that no one can
                        reproach us for not being dedicated to Yugoslavia, us Slovenians have a lot
                        to learn in this regard. We are all too focused solely on our own wartime
                        experience, all too confined in our own little circle. It would serve us
                        well to learn from the positive experiences of other Southern Slavic nations
                        and apply them to ourselves. It is understandable that learning from the
                        brotherly South during the time of old Yugoslavia was difficult and
                        frustrating because we were used to the proponents of Greater Serbian
                        hegemony from the South to bring us nothing but oppression. The situation
                        today is completely different. An egalitarian Yugoslavia is being formed,
                        and for the benefit of ourselves and this egalitarian country, we have to
                        learn from our southern brothers as they have to learn from us."<note

                        the simultaneous resistance of other Yugoslav nations. (…) today, we can
                        enter the Yugoslav concept without worries regarding our national rights.
                        Nowadays, we still fear the old Yugoslavia and think that a Yugoslav
                        community represents a threat to the independent development of the
                        Slovenian nation. It often happens that when we express our thoughts of
                        liberation we do not stress enough the connection to Yugoslavia. However, we
                        have to realize that without Yugoslavia there can be no continuation of the
                        policies and struggles for the liberation of the Slovenian nation. Even our
                        press does not take advantage of the successes of Yugoslav liberation
                        movements in other parts of the country. Let the fourth year of the

                        </note> As it is usual for guerrilla warfare, local circumstances were
                        important in the organisation of the resistance because resistance units
                        could only develop from the bottom up, i.e. from local forces and resources
                        which are necessary for any armed struggle. The leadership of the KPJ, which
                        at the same time took over the leadership of the resistance, decided also at
                        higher levels on a distributed principle because the new occupational
                        borders which divided the state territory – Yugoslavia was divided into 11
                        different occupational areas – represented a great obstacle for achieving
                        their aims because of different conditions for crossing them and different
                        occupational policies. The organisational policy of the guerrilla warfare
                        was at the same time also in line with its general orientation in the
                        domestic politics, which advocated a Yugoslav state, but one that consisted
                        of more (at least five) nations forming national administrative units, which
                        was contrary to the unitary model of the previous Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In
                        1941, the politicians encouraged the creation of national guerrilla
                        commanding units (the so called Main commands of Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia,
                        Sandžak, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Vojvodina, Macedonia), which could lead the
                        guerrilla units on their territories more easily in times of difficult
                        communication with each other. The KPJ tried to oversee and guide the
                        activities of these guerrilla units.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn404"

                        of the KPJ and Supreme Command considered the Partisan Army, as they named
                        the members of the guerrilla units, as an unified army, even though this
                        uniformity was not achieved for a long time, not in the organisational and
                        even less in the operational sense. Each of the partisan armies operated in
                        their respective Yugoslav regions under the leadership of regional political
                        bodies and their own commands. The Supreme Command had the supremacy only by
                        name. They all had to operate with their own forces, taking into account
                        current circumstances that were more or less suitable for armed resistance.
                        Soon after the beginning of the resistance in July 1941, great differences
                        in the inner development and power of the resistance movement arose, even
                        though its leaders obeyed the (very) general guidelines and instructions
                        from the highest command of the party and its military command. In the
                        beginning, the partisan army mobilized most quickly in Serbia and
                        Montenegro, where it was joined by a huge number of members as soon as in
                        the summer of 1941.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn407" n="404">

                        liberation units was forced to deal especially with the issues regarding the
                        partisan units in Serbia, where the Supreme Command was located, and could
                        interfere in other resistance territories only occasionally, in writing or
                        through delegates and individual members, but mostly it had to rely on the
                        initiative of the leadership of individual resistance movements which, as
                        members of the KPJ, fully recognized the authority of KPJ leaders, the
                        Politburo of the KPJ and personally equal the Main, i.e. the Supreme
                        Command. The difference between the centralist hierarchy of the Communist

                        any problems to the leadership. The guerrilla therefore had support also on
                        the organisational level and in operational methods of the Yugoslav
                        Communist Party. The communists also attracted other political groups and
                        individuals to the resistance, but mostly in an informal way. Only in
                        Slovenia did the Communist Party of Slovenia formalise this cooperation with
                        other political groups in the resistance organisation called the Liberation
                        Front of the Slovenian Nation, in which the communists were the most
                        important and most radical political party, but they did not have the
                        greatest number of members. Other groups joined the resistance organisation
                        with the aim of achieving national liberation, and not so much for the
                        radical social changes.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn408" n="405">See

                    <p xml:id="p-185">When, in September 1941, the leadership of the Slovenian
                        resistance movement formally confirmed the fact that it will act as part of
                        the Yugoslav resistance, the leadership of the Liberation Front, which
                        proclaimed itself on the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> September as a
                        temporary national representation called the Slovenian National Liberation

                        the armed resistance. The Slovenian partisan army was also formally included
                        into the common Yugoslav partisan army. Its ordinance defined the inclusion
                        of the Slovenian partisan units as an inclusion of an autonomous and
                        complete organisation under the command of its Supreme Command into the
                        military organisation which was under the command of the Main Command of the

                        Liberation Front was a coalition, such an explicit decision was politically
                        necessary, but at the same time it showed reservations of at least some of
                        the political groups towards the current Yugoslav reality and the emphasized
                        sensitivity of the Slovenian people towards the reinstatement of national
                        sovereignty and especially towards their own military organisation which
                        felt estranged to the Slovenians in the centralist state because it was
                        under a strong Serbian personal and traditional predominance. Such inclusion
                        meant that the Slovenian partisan army started to developed into a direction
                        that was generally determined by the Supreme Command and the commanders
                        attended a meeting of partisan commands in Stolice.<note place="foot"

                        National Liberation Committee was no longer active) became the formal
                        supreme commander of the Slovenian partisan army and confirmed military
                        appointments to the highest level.</p>
                    <p xml:id="p-186">Such relationship between the two levels of army organisation
                        was in force until mid‑1943, even though the partisan army in Slovenia,
                        which was under the immediate command of the Supreme Command, experienced
                        turbulent organisational and operational evolution. In this relationship,
                        the Slovenian partisan units with their command were a separate and complete
                        part of the Yugoslav partisan army, but they had their own forces and
                        capabilities and were independent in their activities, if we ignore the
                        periodical instructions of the Supreme Command regarding the military
                        organisation and operational plans, which were given more as an advice. The
                        operational leadership of the units was still conducted at lower levels, by
                        the so called command of <hi rend="italic">detachment groups</hi> and <hi

                        dilemma which they solved with a compromise. The non-communist members of
                        the Liberation Front leadership were satisfied with the formulation that

                        headquarters and larger units for another two months until he returned to
                        Supreme Command in Bosnia. The officers he brought with him and who should
                        be appointed as commanders of the Slovenian brigades were, upon a

                        brigades and battalions where they could use their military knowledge, but
                        the commanders of these units remained Slovenians. And <persName

                        Yugoslavia, which was divided into several more or less autonomous commands,
                        the question about the future organisation of the Yugoslav armed force arose
                        soon after the resistance movement decided on a political takeover. The
                        question about the organisation of the army and under whose jurisdiction it
                        would be also emerged with the formation of a federal state and, above all,
                        the efforts that the resistance movement would be the successor of the
                        Yugoslav government. Technical means, for example permanent radio
                        connections, enabled a more direct command of the Slovenian NOV and PO on
                        the strategic level and later partly also on the operational level. Since
                        July 1943, the commander of the Supreme Command <persName

                        conducted all appointments of the highest military commanders, not only in
                        main commands, but also in their corps and divisions – also in the Slovenian
                        ones. But this did not mean there were no regular consultations on

                        number of new levers of leadership and command and, in the autumn of 1944,
                        unified the military judiciary, organizational and formational regime, and
                        introduced centralized awarding of officer ranks – first for commanders,

                        which was recognized since the summer of 1944 by the British-American allies
                        and the Soviet Union as an ally and the only Yugoslav force fighting against
                        Germany and National Socialism, and the conquest of Serbia and the former
                        capital Belgrade in cooperation with the Red Army triggered a new dynamics
                        from the political and military perspective. From November 1944 to January
                        1945, the mobilisation of every male resident from Belgrade to south
                        Macedonia was carried out, several new military units were established and
                        the partisan army was renamed into the army of the Democratic and Federal
                        Yugoslavia with three armies. This process ended on 1<hi rend="superscript"
                            >st</hi> March 1945 with the renaming of the Yugoslav NOV in PO into
                        Yugoslav Army, which then founded the fourth army in Dalmatia. At the same
                        time, the priorities of the operational activities of the Yugoslav Army
                        changed – its most important tasks were the final operations and the
                        breakthrough at the so called "Syrmian" and "Bosnian" front, which was
                        established by the German army as it retreated to the north-west. The
                        Supreme command considered the strong partisan forces in the hinterland, in
                        Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia, as an important, but secondary force in the
                        enemy's hinterland, which would be gradually included in the existing units
                        of the Yugoslav Army during the operations for liberation.<note place="foot"

                        army, in which military serviceman of different nationalities would unite
                        into a unified Yugoslav force according to the formula of "brotherhood and
                        unity". In fact, this organisation was actually partly based on the idea of
                        eliminating national differences in terms of the existing national
                        mortgages, but in particular on the establishment of a military force that

                        of an ambitious project of the transformation into a socialist society. With

                    <p xml:id="p-199">The Yugoslav resistance movement, which politically rejected
                        the unitary political structure of the former state, which did not reflect
                        any multinational aspects, soon run into similar problems of interethnic
                        relations. This was also reflected in the formation of its military forces.
                        Patriotism, which was based on nationalism, was an important factor for
                        mobilizing the population for the guerrilla army, which was crucially
                        dependent on the voluntary mobilization and support of the local population.
                        The solutions which the resistance movement tried to implement under the
                        leadership of the Communists were a compromise. They formally maintained
                        some elements of the (Slovenian) national army, but in fact it was the
                        communists who, in the name of discipline as well as their special objective
                        of a revolutionary takeover, led the army into a similar centralist
                        organisational form as it was before the war in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia –
                        which is imminent in the military organisation. However, this model took its
                        final shape only when it was no longer politically decisive, since they
                        seized power and became the political foundation of a new Yugoslav statehood
                        during the final operations against the Nazi Germany in Yugoslavia. The
                        army, which was named Yugoslav Army in the first post-war years, was, as the
                        sum of all influences, an institution which clearly supported the
                        centralistic revolutionary authority, despite the formal federal
                        organisation of the state. The unrealised formal competence of the Slovenian
                        federal state in the military field became something unspoken, but
                        internally present in the internal political developments of the next 36
                        years of the socialist Slovenia.</p>

                    aspects of the relationship between the occupying forces and the occupied
                    territory and population as well, primarily the aspects that are disparagingly
                    called "aiding the enemy", "supporting the occupying forces", "working against
                    fundamental national interests" or even "treason" or "high treason". However,
                    modern historiography of World War II is giving more and more attention to the
                    study of this complex and sometimes contradictory phenomenon. In addition to
                    concrete particulars of each instance of collaboration, the various increasingly
                    thorough monographs as well as comparative studies are now directing their
                    critical analyses as well as both original and unoriginal systematizations
                    towards the very concept of collaboration as well.<note place="foot"

                    mentioned moral connotations, it is clear that the common idea of collaboration
                    is the result of a subjective approach; however, it should be pointed out that
                    the study will only focus on the situation in the territories occupied by the
                    Axis powers, primarily Nazi Germany, and not on those occupied by the Soviet
                    Union or even the Western Allies.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-201">Despite the limitations and reservations, however, the fundamental
                    material and methodological foundations remain relevant, as no collaboration as
                    we understand it can happen without them: these are occupation, i.e. occupying
                    (enemy) forces, on the one hand, and occupied territory with its political
                    structures and population as the subjects of occupation on the other. Most
                    researchers agree that the decisive agent in this dichotomy is generally the
                    occupying force, who makes decisions, i.e. allows for, wants or even demands the
                    cooperation of the occupied. Various systems of occupation established primarily
                    by the Nazis across Europe – from the Channel Islands to the Caucasus – thus
                    represent the natural framework as well as a conditio sine qua non that
                    determines the nature and extent of collaboration that would occur and even
                    whether it would occur at all.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn437" n="434">

                    That is to say, the systems of occupation reflect the short- as well as
                    long-term goals and plans that the occupying forces have for the occupied
                    territories and their populations, thus indirectly, or even directly,
                    influencing the forms and degrees of collaboration.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-202">Of course, there was virtually no territory or population that
                    would want the Nazi occupation or would actively strived to join the German
                    Reich. This was only the case with some more or less Nazified German minorities,
                    i.e. Volksdeutschers, who also frequently acted as the fifth column following
                    the occupation. On the other hand, researchers have generally come to agree that
                    only a minority of the population usually participated in active resistance. But
                    if that was so, did the rest of the population collaborate as well? While this
                    is obviously a rhetorical question with a negative answer, the fact remains that
                    the majority had to somehow adapt to the new situation and choose a strategy of
                    surviving the occupation in accordance with their values, abilities and own
                    judgement of the situation. As our subject here is collaboration, the dilemma
                    can also be rephrased as the question of what degree of social interaction with
                    the enemy is still compatible with patriotism or the generally expected degree
                    and form of loyalty to one's homeland.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn438" n="435">

                    have ranged from passive acceptance to voluntary and active support for the
                    administration of the occupying forces or even ideological identification with
                    them. That is, many people thought that collaboration would prevent greater
                    evils from befalling the population or that, as Marshall <persName
                        ref="#pers-PétainPhilippe">Pétain</persName> believed, his collaboration
                    would shield the French people from the German surge.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-203">Of course, this is not the place to expound on the complexity and
                    specific features of collaboration in Europe; however, we do have to return
                    briefly to the issue of the Nazi occupation policy and even the war goals of the
                    Axis powers, particularly of <persName ref="#pers-HitlerAdolf"
                        >Hitler's</persName> Reich. With regard to the global government of Europe
                    after the presumed German victory, it has to be said that neither the Nazi
                    command nor <persName ref="#pers-HitlerAdolf">Hitler</persName> were explicitly
                    concerned with the issue and that the only constant of the Nazi policy in this
                    regard was simply the creation of the great German Reich that would, naturally,
                    include the Baltic area, and presumably also Ukraine, in addition to the Czech
                    Republic and Poland. In any case, the Nazi interests were particularly targeted
                    to the east of Europe (Generalplan Ost), while the Nazi's concerns regarding the
                    Western and Northern Europe were mostly associated with the question whether the
                    Reich should include other Germanic countries as well or whether a different
                    pan-Germanic community should be created. With this plan, France would be
                    reduced to its circa-1500 borders. In the context of the ideas of the so-called
                    New Europe or European Community, the Nazi circles sporadically came up with
                    ideas such as the seven European federations joined in a kind of
                    super-federation. The most serious yet still unofficial document in this regard
                    was drafted in March 1943 by <persName ref="#pers-RibbentropJoachimvon"
                        >Ribbentrop's</persName> Foreign Ministry, which discussed a European union
                    of sovereign countries and represented a kind of an answer to the Allies'
                    Atlantic Charter. The following year, the central SS office in Berlin published
                    a similar document planning a German Reich at the core of Europe surrounded by a
                    circle of neighbouring peoples as well as the outer circle of the so-called
                    "Randvölker". The whole arrangement would be called the "Europäische
                    Eidgenossenschaft". The plans even included a European passport.<note

                    undoubtedly showed that the Nazi plans were primarily focused, as already
                    mentioned, on the creation of a great German Reich with its great economic
                    environment in the context of the so-called Lebensraum. Polish historian
                        <persName ref="#pers-MadajczykCzesłav">Madajczyk</persName> thus classifies
                    the main objectives and phases of the Nazi occupation policies into four stages:
                    1) Creation of the German Lebensraum in the East, 2) Preliminary preparations
                    for the creation of the great German Reich through the absorption of German
                    "Volksgruppen" and Germanic peoples, 3) Securing a long-term or "eternal"
                    subjugation of different regions with the help of the other Axis powers, 4)
                    Occasional and limited interventions in other areas.<note place="foot"

                    and oppression manifested itself as the three main types of occupation. The
                    first type was characterized by the direct expansion of the Reich's government
                    to the annexed territories annexed de iure or de facto (part of eastern Belgium,
                    Luxembourg, Alsace, part of Lorraine, western Poland, Sudetenland, Lower Styria
                    and Upper Carniola). The second type includes occupied territories with
                    different forms of civilian administration (Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands,
                    Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Polish General Government,
                    Reichskommissariat Ostland, Reichskommissariat Ukraine), and the third includes
                    territories under military administration (Channel Islands, Belgium, northern
                    France, Serbia, parts of Greece and of course other areas following the
                    capitulation of Italy). The Army Commands and the Rear Army Area Commands at the
                    Eastern Front functioned as special kinds of military administrations.<note

                <p xml:id="p-205">Within these systems of occupation, explicit German needs and
                    incentives accompanied by their dissemination among the inhabitants of the
                    occupied territories resulted in different forms and degrees of collaboration.
                    The behaviour patterns in the native population which reflected to nothing more
                    than efforts to survive and preserve the normal course of public life were
                    helpful for the occupying forces as well. They allowed or sought "higher" forms
                    of collaboration only in case they deemed them potentially beneficial in the
                    short or perhaps even long term. The whole body of collaboration was thus –
                    self-evidently – in the service of the realization of Nazi control over the
                    occupied territories and therefore also indirectly in the service of successful
                    continuation of the war effort. From such perspective, it is crystal clear that
                    the "tolerance" of collaboration in Eastern Europe was nothing more than a
                    tactical manoeuvre. A German victory would mean that collaborators as relatively
                    autonomous entities and, in particular, their non-German national affiliation
                    would have to disappear. In this regard, things were different in Western Europe
                    as the Nazis did not have any final plans for that region; of course,
                    collaboration was welcomed, but it was especially the political collaboration
                    that represented something of a double-edged sword for the Nazis since it
                    implied a certain type of partnership and therefore also future obligations.
                    With minor exceptions in the Baltic area, the Nazis tried to avoid such
                    obligations, especially in the East, where such commitments were completely out
                    of the question.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn442" n="439">

                    focus was primarily on the short-term concrete interests of the occupying
                    administration is also indicated by the seemingly unusual fact that Germans
                    sometimes turned down cooperation with minor local Fascist groups, preferring
                    instead to set up an administration on their own or in collaboration with other
                    domestic political forces who enjoyed greater support among the population. Such
                    was the case in Poland and the Czechia on the one hand, and on the other there
                    were the cases of Belgium and Denmark.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-206">Further in this paper, we will briefly present some concrete
                    examples of the Nazi occupying regimes in Western and Eastern Europe and point
                    out some of their features. Each example will be followed by a description of
                    the forms of collaboration, wherein we will focus on the ideological foundations
                    or backgrounds that had resulted in such varying forms and degrees of
                    collaboration. It is precisely under the ideological aspect of the relationship
                    between the occupying power and the occupied people that the phenomenon of
                    collaboration is usually shown in its clearest and most extreme form, and this
                    is where explicit support to the occupying power as well as identification with
                    the Nazis are most evident – in such cases, collaboration is voluntary and the
                    most intense. The first direct manifestation of an ideology which was identical
                    with or obviously related to National Socialism was the ideological
                    collaboration in the narrow sense; in this regard, various Fascist and
                    para-Fascist movements or parties that may have been active even before the
                    occupation or many of them appearing and becoming active after the country had
                    been occupied should be mentioned. A typical example in this category were the
                    so-called Paris “collaborationism”, who were labelled by using this term in
                    order to distinguish them from the "national" collaboration of Vichy.<note

                    </note> The ideological potential, of course, does not only result in
                    ideological collaboration and the directly related political collaboration, but
                    can also act as an incentive and a trigger for other types of collaboration,
                    e.g. voluntary enrolment in the SS in order to actively participate in the fight
                    against Bolshevism. Such motivations, of course, cannot be excluded even in
                    cases of economic collaboration. In this regard, the contrasting cases of
                        <persName ref="#pers-RenaultLouis">Renault</persName> and Michelin are often
                    cited. The former voluntarily offered to manufacture tanks for the Germans, but
                    even the latter, albeit being in contact with the resistance, had to somehow do
                    business with the occupying forces.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn444" n="441">

                    Belgium on 10 May 1940, occupying its entire territory by the end of the month.
                    The king remained in the country but retreated into voluntary isolation and
                    declared himself a sort of prisoner. The Government authorized its
                    secretaries-general to administer the country and then crossed France to retreat
                    to London, where it settled as a Government in exile. The Belgian territory,
                    with the French departments of Nord and Pas de Calais annexed to it by the
                    Germans, were subject to a permanent military administration. Although the

                    the German occupying forces immediately started to show favouritism for the
                    Flemish part of Belgium, to which the Germans also included the city of
                    Brussels. In addition to linguistic and political aspects, the favouritism was
                    primarily reflected by the fact that the Germans were quick to release the
                    Flemish prisoners of war, while those of the Walloon origin had to remain in
                    captivity. In any case, collaboration in Belgium was started immediately and was
                    evident in all areas of life. The main ideological basis for collaboration was
                    the Flemish nationalism, Belgian version of Fascism and a rather widespread
                    rejection of democracy. The Flemish nationalism was practised by different
                    parties and movements characterized by varying degrees of extremism and
                    flirtation with the German Nazism. The largest such party was the Flemish
                    National Union (Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond, VNV), which supported Flemish
                    independence and, in perspective, what was called Dietsland, i.e. a national
                    union of all Dutch-speaking countries, which, according to VNV, included
                    Luxembourg, which would later become part of the German federation. The Germans
                    were not too enthusiastic about the idea, but they did liked receiving favours
                    from the Flemish nationalists who soon took over positions in the council of
                    secretaries-general as well as all lower administrative levels. Besides, VNV
                    supported a social regime based on the people's solidarity and corporate
                    programme. Among other, more extreme Flemish groups, there was also the Union of
                    Dutch National Solidarists (Verbond van Dietsche National-Solidaristen,
                    Verdinaso) and the German-Flemish Labour Community (Duitschen-Vlamsche
                    Arbeidsgemeenschap, Devlag). The latter was explicitly pro-German; it supported
                    the idea of annexing Flanders to the German Reich and later became something of

                    occupied by the Germans, which was easy as Luxembourg lacked an army, with the
                    exception of a volunteer company whose members served as gendarme reservists and
                    ceremonial guards. In any case, the Nazi regime always treated the
                    German-speaking Luxembourgers as Germans, so all further measures taken by the
                    occupying administration were focused on what was called "the return to the
                    Reich" (Heim ins Reich). Following a one-month period of military
                    administration, Luxembourg was practically annexed to the Reich as its territory
                    was annexed to Gau Koblenz-Trier, which was renamed into Gau Moselland in
                    February 1941. Gauleiter Gustav Simon also became chief of the civilian
                    administration and his activities during the initial months were centred
                    primarily on the dismantling of Luxembourg's statehood, eventually allowing
                    Simon to solemnly declare that Luxembourg had ceased to exist and to forbid any
                    use of the name. The title of Simon's proclamation from August 1941 was very
                    distinctive: "The Period of Democracy is Over".<note place="foot"

                    German forms, and even the wearing of the Basque beret, which was considered a
                    French symbol, was prohibited. Interestingly, however, Nazis never executed a de

                <p xml:id="p-211">This was probably partly also due to the fact that most
                    Luxembourgers were far from thrilled about the occupation or their "return" to
                    the Reich. Individual Nazi measures prompted demonstrations and strikes, which
                    in turn led to bloody German countermeasures and to the Nazis starting, though
                    not finishing, limited deportation of Luxembourger families to Silesia.
                    Gauleiter Simon even came up with a referendum, at which Luxembourgers were
                    supposed to provide answers to concrete questions affirming their German
                    affiliation. However, the referendum was a fiasco, as 98 % of responses
                    indicated that the people considered themselves Luxembourgers by culture and
                    nationality and their language Luxembourgish. The Gauleiter was forced to
                    invalidate the referendum.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn456" n="453">

                    the Nazis initially instituted a compulsory labour scheme and then also a
                    compulsory military service in August 1942, upon the granting of limited citizen
                    rights. Recruitment involved those born between 1920 and 1927, over 15,000
                    draftees in total, however, draft evasion and desertion led to only a little
                    over 11,000 actually joining the German army, of which almost 3,000 died on

                    authorities urged Luxembourgers to enter NSDAP, i.e. the Nazi party, and its
                    professional organizations, and men in particular to volunteer for the SS and
                    Wehrmacht. About 4,000 Luxembourgers joined the NSDAP, and local historians

                    Silesia and Sudetenland. Alsatians suffered a similar fate, accompanied by the
                    settlement of Volksdeutschers from elsewhere. French and German Jews living in
                    both regions were also temporarily deported to France. In terms of expected
                    measures, this was followed by a more or less compulsory involvement of the
                    population in large organizations ("Deutsche Volksgemeinschaft"), by a
                    compulsory labour scheme in April 1942 and by an announcement of compulsory
                    military service accompanied by the draftees receiving a German citizenship in
                    August 1942. In both regions, 200,000 young men were drafted, with about 40,000
                    failing to return home, most of whom of course fell on the Russian Front. In
                    1944, Alsace and Lorraine also saw compulsory mobilization into the SS.<note

                    colonial expansion was Poland. After military operations concluded in September
                    1939, the Polish territory occupied by Germany was, as previously planned, split
                    into two parts. The western territories with an area of 90,000 km<hi
                        rend="superscript">2</hi> and a population of almost 10 million were annexed
                    to the Reich. They were joined to Gau Wartheland (Posen), Gau Upper Silesia and
                    Gau Danzig-Western Prussia. After some hesitation by <persName
                        ref="#pers-HitlerAdolf">Hitler</persName> regarding the creation of the
                    so-called "Restaat Polen", the rest of Poland was assigned the status of a
                    semi-colonial dependent territory and named General Government
                    ("Generalgouvernement"). In this part of Poland, all power was held by the
                    German civilian administration headed by General Governor <persName
                        ref="#pers-FrankHans">Hans Frank</persName> and based in Krakow. However,
                    following the attack on the Soviet Union, the district of Galicia was annexed to
                    the Government as well. According to <persName ref="#pers-HitlerAdolf"
                        >Hitler's</persName> and <persName ref="#pers-HimmlerHeinrich"
                        >Himmler's</persName> plans, the annexed territories would be Germanized
                    within ten years; the measures that followed in order to achieve this brought an
                    unprecedented level of terror waged against a European nation. The
                    intelligentsia, the clergy and other distinguished Polish classes were killed,
                    taken to concentration camps or deported to the General Government without any
                    concern paid to their needs. Together with other categories, 750,000 people were
                    deported there, and deportation of a few million more was being planned. Polish
                    Jews suffered a similar fate, only worse. All traces of Polish cultural and
                    general presence were destroyed, while the seized and emptied estates and areas
                    were settled by Germans from elsewhere, primarily those from the Baltic
                        countries.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn470" n="467">

                    autonomous, while Polish national presence in culture, education and science was
                    more restricted. In this phase, Nazis wanted to push the Poles to the lowest

                <p xml:id="p-216">In such circumstances, especially in the annexed territories,
                    there was little space left for collaboration, especially collaboration in the
                    narrow sense, i.e. conscious and active support of the Nazi plans. In these
                    regions, Nazis allowed no activities that could be called Polish whatsoever, not
                    even collaboration. Ideology and politics had nothing to do with this, any
                    reasons for potential cooperation with the authorities, which was only possible
                    at the individual level, were distinctively social. It was about survival and
                    keeping up at least an appearance of a minimum preservation of human dignity.
                    This became particularly apparent in the mass enlistment of Poles to the
                    so-called "Deutsche Volksliste” which the Nazis formed in western Poland,
                    initially to serve as something of a list of the German population. The
                    organization had four divisions, ranging from pure and active Germans to the
                    so-called renegades. The last two categories were able to obtain German
                    citizenship; however, this was subject to revocation. Because Germanization was
                    slow, pragmatic reasons led Nazis to at least outwardly allow extremely broad
                    integration, which led to over two million former Polish citizens being included
                    on the list. However, as they became German citizens, they also became subject
                    to compulsory military service. About 200,000 Poles were thus drafted into the
                    Wehrmacht. <persName ref="#pers-MadajczykCzesłav">Madajczyk</persName> wonders
                    whether these were renegades. He doesn't provide an answer, however, he
                    sometimes uses a label indicating that at least some of them were
                        opportunists.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn473" n="470">

                <p xml:id="p-217">With regard to the rest of the Polish territory, i.e. the General
                    Government, the collaboration issue was much more complicated and the situation
                    much more varied. What is certain, however, is that based on historiographical
                    research carried out in the past few decades, the issue can no longer be easily
                    eliminated with the slogan of the wartime Polish government in exile, that
                    Poland was simply "a land without a <persName ref="#pers-QuislingVidkun"

                    yet come to a final decision on what to do with the Polish territory, there were
                    actually a number of candidates to fill in the "position". As early as November
                    1939, Germans were soliciting a group of imprisoned Polish aristocrats to form a
                    government. Similarly, they tried to persuade peasant leader <persName

                    proposals were always turned down.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn474" n="471">

                    for a while; however, after a few years, as the Reich was starting to lose the
                    war, the Germans made a number of similar steps. They first discussed the search
                    for a common anti-Communist and anti-Soviet platform with former Prime Minister
                        <persName ref="#pers-KozłowskiLeon">Leon Kozłowski</persName>, later with

                        >Bór-Komorowski</persName>. All of them turned down the offers, although,
                    true enough, even <persName ref="#pers-HitlerAdolf">Hitler</persName> was
                    against such arrangements. Nevertheless, <persName ref="#pers-HimmlerHeinrich"
                        >Himmler's</persName> people and the Gestapo command continued their
                    attempts to form ties with local divisions of the resistance movement in order
                    to recruit them for the anti-Soviet fight. On the other hand, intiatives were
                    also coming in from the Polish side. The most infamous was the offer of the
                    pro-German Władysław Studnicki to command a totalitarian Polish state annexed to
                        Germany.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn475" n="472">

                    Other groups, such as "Falanga" and "Narodowe Siły Zbrojne", were wagering
                    between resistance and alignment with the Germans, which was of course due to
                    concerns about Communism and the looming Soviet domination in this part of

                    were other forms occurring, particularly at the individual level, which were

                    issue was rather marginal for workers and peasants, it became much more critical
                    for journalists, artists and bureaucrats. Researchers thus unanimously agree
                    that the "Przełom" paper was fully collaborationist in character, which was,
                    among other things, indicated by the fact that it began to be published only in

                    this regard, the Polish police was suspicious as well. It remained on its
                    position, had over 11,000 officers and was known as "The Blue Police" or
                    "Policja granatowa", as it was called in Polish. Although the police
                    participated in the fight against the Warsaw ghetto uprising, it was otherwise
                    full of confidantes of the resistance. Additionally, the Polish Criminal Police
                    was active towards the end of the war, as were also the Ukrainian Auxiliary
                    Police, the Jewish Ghetto Police and, last but not least, the so-called
                    "Trawniki men", who performed various guard duties in addition to suppressing

                    becoming increasingly interested in recruiting the Government's Poles for
                    military participation. While German generals had been advocating this since the

                    events in the Baltic area in the summer following the German attack on the

                    population welcomed the arriving German squads as liberators and many joined the
                    Germans in their fight against the Red Army. The locals took power and formed
                    provisional governments, except in Estonia where the local "Political Council"
                    did not declare itself the government. Although such governments were not
                    recognized by the Germans, they were tolerated for a while but eventually forced
                    to dissolve. The Germans instituted civilian administration and integrated the
                    Baltic states with Belarus as districts of a special occupation zone called
                    "Reichskommissariat Ostland", which was headed by commissar <persName

                <p xml:id="p-221">To the great disappointment of the people and their elites,
                    Germans showed no intention whatsoever to restore the independence of the three
                    countries. Not only that, they did not even show willingness to restore the
                    original tenure situation, as the Soviet authorities had already collectivized
                    the land and nationalized businesses. The companies were taken over by large
                    authorized German companies, which was initially followed by voluntary and later
                    by compulsory deportations of workers to Germany. Lower administration bodies
                    continued to operate at the local levels, except in large cities. Cultural and
                    religious activities at the national level remained in the autonomous
                    jurisdiction of the locals.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-222">It is uncertain whether the cooperation of Baltic people with the
                    German occupying forces, which there was no shortage of, can rightfully be
                    labelled collaboration in the original, negative sense of the word. It is namely
                    a fact that the Balts owed absolutely nothing to the country they belonged to in
                    1941. Not only that, the still-vivid memories and unhealed wounds reinforced
                    their anti-Russian and anti-Bolshevik feelings that became their main motivation
                    for cooperation with the Nazis. This was also partly true for their
                    participation in the Holocaust. Informal groups had already been exterminating
                    Jews during war operations – the activities which later received support from
                    the Nazis and were, therefore, intensified even further. In 1941 alone, over
                    100,000 Jews were killed, with only the "Arajs Kommando" killing 26,000. The
                    anti-Semitism had roots in the old times, while those of more recent origin
                    supposedly stemmed from the Soviet occupation and its policies which leaned
                    heavily on the Jews. However, this was only part of the truth.<note place="foot"

                    various military and police units. The most famous of these units, and also the
                    highest in numbers,, were the formal mobilization-based defensive battalions
                    ("Schutzmannschafts-Bataillone"), which were followed by new mobilizations, such
                    as the one in Autumn 1943. The response was poor, particularly in Lithuania, but
                    it improved in the winter as Lithuania relegated the command over the "local
                    divisions" to General <persName ref="#pers-PlechavičiusPovilas">Povilas
                        Plechavičius</persName>. Latvia and Estonia continued to mobilize troops
                    into ancillary police units and legions which the SS command intended to re-form
                    into domestic Waffen-SS units. When this eventually took place, two divisions
                    were formed in Latvia, i.e. the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and 19<hi
                        rend="superscript">th</hi> "Waffen-Grenadier-Divisions der SS", and one in

                    der SS (estn. Nr.1)". Each numbered between 13,000 and 15,000 men. Despite
                    different promises, the units were deployed to the Eastern Front and even
                    elsewhere in Europe, rather than domestically and in the fight against
                    partisans. In 1944, however, the front line again moved close to the Baltic
                    countries and the fear of a renewed Soviet occupation spurred greater success in
                    further mobilizations and calls to arms. This was particularly true in the case
                    of Estonia, whose people felt the greatest threat. All together, as many as
                    70,000 Estonians, 110,000 Latvians, and 37,000 Lithuanians served in the
                    "German" units. Estonians, in particular, fought tooth and nail against the

                    their collaboration were typical of occupied territories that formed the core
                    area of the Nazi invasion interests. Among other states, this area certainly
                    also included Slovenia, or at least its northern parts. The subject is further
                    treated below. However, we must first point to the already known fact that the
                    Nazi Germany, and to a lesser extent also the other Axis powers, operated wildly
                    different types of occupation regimes in its vast occupied territory, which were
                    accompanied by different forms of collaboration development. Slovenia's
                    surrounding area includes countries that, during World War II, suffered fates
                    very different from the ones described above as well as from that of Slovenia.
                    These countries are Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia and Italy. In the Fascist camp,
                    all of them were considered independent countries, despite being more or less
                    subordinate to the German Reich. Italy and Hungary were German allies, while
                    Slovakia and Croatia were created as new vassal states. <persName

                    be ascribed to the nationalist potential of the Ustashe and the unresolved
                    national question of Yugoslavia. However, both states were created in order to
                    split up or demolish larger countries, i.e. Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. NDH
                    was actually occupied from the very beginning, Slovakia and Germany from 1944,
                    and Italy from the autumn of 1943. Before the occupation, Slovakia and Hungary
                    were more or less autonomous, having only to satisfy the Nazi demands, which
                    were generally related to the supply of goods in the case of Slovakia, and to
                    military aid in the case of Hungary. By 1944, both countries had only partly
                    satisfied the Nazi demands regarding the extradition and extermination of Jews.
                    Italy and NDH had strong indigenous Fascist movements which resulted in great
                    tragedies, particularly the racist version in Croatia. In Slovakia and Hungary,
                    Fascist groups were weak and only became notable once the countries were
                    occupied. Among these countries, Italy's case particularly stands out; it
                    includes the fall of the Fascist state in the autumn of 1943, which was formed
                    upon <persName ref="#pers-HitlerAdolf">Hitler's</persName> mercy, having become
                    the vassal "Italian Social Republic" headed by <persName ref="#pers-HitlerAdolf"

                    from the very beginning; in other countries, however, collaboration only started
                    after the German occupation. Especially in Italy, where the new Republican
                    Fascists did everything they could to help the occupying forces deal with the
                    Italian resistance movement.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn486" n="483">For

                    part of Styria (Štajerska), Upper Carniola (Gorenjska) and parts of Carynthia
                    (Koroška), a number of parallels can be drawn regarding the situation in other
                    occupied areas which the Nazis considered their core national territory and were
                    thus the first in line to be annexed to the Reich. As we point out these
                    parallels, we have practically already defined annexationism as the primary
                    common characteristic. The only difference was that Germany annexed some of
                    these areas in full, while Luxembourg, Alsace, a part of Lorraine and the
                    Slovenian occupied territories were never formally annexed. However, there was
                    practically no difference between both categories as these territories were
                    annexed de facto. They were joined to the German (neighbouring) gaus, the
                    authorities instituted labour schemes, military service and enforced German laws
                    as well as administrative and political systems. The only detail that stood out
                    was the population, which the racist Nazi authorities considered too immature to
                    acquire German citizenships. In order to facilitate this, all these territories
                    were subjected to active Germanization and tiered systems of citizenship were
                    instituted, as well as formally voluntary membership in mass organizations. In
                    this respect, the "Steirischer Heimatbund" in Štajerska and "Kärtner Volksbund"
                    in Gorenjska can be compared to the "Volksdeutsche Bewegung" in Luxembourg,
                    "Deutsche Volksgemeinschaft" in Alsace, and especially to the "Deutsche
                    Volksliste" in Poland.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-227">In order to quickly give a certain territory a German character,
                    Nazis resorted to measures of mass deportation and expulsion of the local
                    population and its replacement with Volksdeutschers from across Europe. This was
                    typical of all the cases described herein, with the exception of Belgium which
                    retained its individuality even in the visions of Nazis, as well as the Baltic
                    countries whose colonisation was postponed until the far future. In the
                    "Italian" Province of Ljubljana, the situation with its retained cultural and,
                    to a certain extent, administrative autonomy was comparable to the German system
                    of occupation in the Baltic countries; however, the latter were granted a higher
                    level of self-government right up to the end. This was also true for the
                    Province of Ljubljana, but only from the Autumn of 1943 onward, when the
                    province was occupied by the Germans.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-228">Looking at the phenomenon and specific features of collaboration,
                    the developments in Slovenia were not at all comparable to those in Belgium,
                    where all forms of collaboration were present, with special emphasis on
                    ideological collaboration and extremely strong volunteer SS units. To a certain
                    degree, the situation in the Baltic area was similar; however, the main drive
                    for mobilization there was the fear of Communism and the Soviet Union. To a
                    certain extent, similarities can be observed with the development of
                    collaboration in central Slovenia, primarily due to concerns about the
                    possibility of a Communist takeover which could be anticipated from the actions
                    of the Partisan movement under the Communist command. Unlike the situation in
                    Belgium and, to a lesser extent, that in Luxembourg, the Baltic countries, and
                    Poland, there was virtually no Fascist movement in Slovenia. It would be
                    possible, however, to draw some weak parallels between Fascism and the so-called
                        <persName ref="#pers-RupnikLeon">Rupnik</persName> circle during <persName
                        ref="#pers-RupnikLeon">Rupnik's</persName> provincial administration in
                    Ljubljana established after the capitulation of Italy. With regard to police and
                    military form of collaboration, Slovenia and Belgium are again impossible to
                    compare, with Belgium having been greatly influenced by the Flemish nationalism
                    that acted as a trigger. While the situation was similar in the Baltic
                    countries, in Slovenia the already mentioned key role in this respect was played
                    by the fear of and resistance against Communism, i.e. a sort of
                    counter-revolutionary drive. In the German-occupied Slovenian territory as at
                    before 1943, collaboration was prominent among the German minority and the
                    opportunistic part of the local population, which was reminiscent of the
                    situation in Luxembourg, Alsace and Poland. As was the case in Poland, the
                    Slovenian political and military collaboration with a Slovene national character
                    was either not accepted by the Nazis or was considered unnecessary (with minor
                    exceptions in Gorenjska occurring towards the end of the war). Similarly as
                    elsewhere, there were Slovenes volunteering for the SS and Wehrmacht, although
                    the numbers were limited. Looking at the big picture, it is clear that the
                    situation in Slovenia can be compared to that in other countries, particularly
                    those occupied and annexed to the Reich by the Nazis. However, Slovenia, which
                    was, unlike other areas, initially occupied by three different powers, retains
                    some of its original features.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn488" n="485">For

                <p xml:id="p-229">World War II affected everybody's life, embroiling not only
                    soldiers and leaving its mark on them and their families, but also invading the
                    general civil sphere on multiple levels and thus determining the everyday lives
                    of urban and rural populations across the entire Slovenia. Slovenian
                    historiography focusing on World War II has produced a comparatively large body
                    of work consisting of academic and scholar texts; these, however, mostly shed
                    light on political and military aspects. The present article thus attempts to
                    show what everyday life was like in Slovenia during World War II, an issue that
                    has not yet been considered by historiography (at least not in detail), and in
                    order to do so relies on fragments from various archives, on printed sources and
                    memoirs and especially on periodical publications. Although the latter is not
                    particularly revealing – from the very beginning of the war, the press was
                    subject to censorship and later faced problems due to paper shortages and was

                    forces against the population in all aspects of life as well as other hardships
                    that everybody was facing during the time of war.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-230">From 1941 to 1945, Slovenia was primarily characterized by the
                    violence perpetrated by the occupying forces against the population that was
                    clear in all walks of life and culminated in physical terror. Repressive
                    measures were used by all occupying countries as they counted on such measures
                    to effectively support their plans for the forcible assimilation of Slovenes,
                    which would of course be preceded by the annexation of the occupied Slovenian
                    territory to their own countries. However, whether people lived or died was
                    determined not only by the occupying forces, but also by the two "companions" of
                    war: the "danger from above" and the scarcity of all necessities of life –
                    particularly comestibles – which form the central theme of this article.</p>

                    Italian-occupied territory after annexation, the guidelines followed by the
                    Italian occupying forces were initially softer. In this occupied area, men were
                    not subject to being drafted, the Province was bi-lingual and Slovenes were
                    allowed to be involved with the administration. Cultural autonomy was planned as
                    well, with the Italians counting on a widespread cooperation of the Slovenian
                    nation with the Fascist regime. On the other hand, all political parties were
                    disbanded, while cultural, sports, charity and other non-political organizations
                    and associations were generally incorporated into the Italian system. The
                    Italians were also more tolerant towards the Slovenian press (which was,
                    however, heavily censored) and the school system. Regarding the latter, numerous
                    new ideas were implemented to gradually facilitate the incorporation of the
                    Slovenian system of education into the Italian framework, and throughout the
                    war, classes were conducted in Slovene. The Ljubljana university remained
                    operational throughout the Italian occupation; starting with autumn 1943,
                    however, it was only open to students who were there to take their exams. After
                    the September 1943 capitulation of Italy, the Province of Ljubljana was occupied
                    by the Germans who incorporated it into the newly formed operational zone called

                    were well-visited throughout the war, with one of the reason being that the
                    "Slovene language was not suppressed and, more importantly, there was a Slovene

                    military strategy and engagements would take on a completely different form in
                    the future. They assumed that a new war would hurt not only the soldiers on the

                    civilian populations in the rear as well, particularly the populations of major
                    cities, centres of industry and settlements along important traffic (road and
                    rail) routes, and hit, in addition to the people, their homes and industrial

                    with the Ministry of the Interior and the Administration of the Red Cross
                    Society, education and awareness campaigns were the responsibility of individual
                    banates and commanders of army groups, and were executed by city administrative
                    authorities. Numerous municipalities thus established "protection committees"
                    that worked with civil authorities to train the people for anti-aircraft
                    protection and defence. These committees organized various information lectures
                    and exhibitions on anti-aircraft protection, and the subject was frequently
                    discussed in newspapers and academic literature, with cinemas and the radio also
                    informing the people of certain details associated with various defence services
                    and procedures. In the years prior to World War II, Slovenia held a number of
                    air raid drills (with "staged air raids") in which the civilians were able to

                    squads were being trained for cleaning up the ground in case of an air raid.
                    Provisional field clinics and first aid teams that would take care of casualties
                    were organized as well. A defence measure was planned according to which people,

                <p xml:id="p-243">Although anti-aircraft protection of the Drava Banate in the 1930s
                    was comprehensive in the sense of territorial coverage (the network included all
                    major and strategically important cities), it was inadequately funded and thus
                    lacking in material organization. This fact left a mark on the doctrine of
                    anti-aircraft defence. The effectiveness of passive defence was questioned by
                    those in power as well as the media, which pointed out its ineffectiveness in
                    terms of propaganda and education, and cautioned that the public was not taking
                    it seriously because of its poor level of readiness and lacking equipment. The
                    truth of this is indicated by a fragment of an article on a black-out drill in
                    Maribor: "In particular, one could note that the people living in poor
                    neighbourhoods of the city were extremely disciplined, while virtually every
                    second window and especially large stairwells remained lit in the big blocks of
                    flats housing mostly the intelligentsia and the better-off population. With
                    respect to factories, where issues in this regard were expected to be most
                    pronounced, the managers generally followed their instructions. The only
                    exception was /.../ one major factory. The whole building was lit as normal and
                    visible from afar. /.../ We do not know whether the company was penalized or
                    not, but it definitely should have been, and the penalty should have been made
                    public, so that the people could see nobody was privileged or exempt."<note

                <p xml:id="p-244">Once the war began, anti-aircraft defence and protection drills,
                    black-out drills and dry runs for alarm activities turned into an everyday
                    reality. Throughout the war, official policy dictated the black-out of all
                    private and public spaces as well as vehicles. The hours of black-out changed
                    with the seasons, and the changes were noted in the official gazette. Protection
                    authorities called on the people to be particularly mindful of their actions in
                    cases of air-raid alarms. Throughout the war, people were encouraged to be
                    prepared and always have the following ready: water and sand, bags with clothes,
                    blankets, torches, food, thermos bottles, children's toys, documents, money,
                    valuables and small works of art. Upon hearing the alarm sound, people were
                    supposed to remain calm, close all gas valves, lock their apartments and go to
                    the bomb shelter with these bags. During the air-raid alarm, civilians were not
                    allowed to freely move outside. The only people who were permitted to do so were
                    those with passes issued by the Anti-Aircraft Protection Committee and members
                    of the military.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn518" n="515">

                    building or group of buildings had to have an appropriate bomb shelter. Such
                    shelters had to be adequately spacious and resistant to fragments, fire and
                    falling ruins. They had to be located in the basement; if this was truly not
                    possible, they could also be set up on the ground floor, in the centre of the
                    building. Shelters had to avoid areas with gas pipes as well as rooms with steam
                    boilers and similar equipment. The doors and windows of shelters had to be
                    secured in such a way as not to be pierced by shell fragments. As they had to be
                    fireproof as well, earth was piled up in front of any openings and compacted; in
                    some cases, crates and sacks were packed with soil instead and again placed in
                    front of openings. The latter were frequently blocked with wooden beams.
                    Shelters also had to offer protection against gasses. All holes, cracks and
                    keyholes had to be plugged and pasted over with paper. Window panes had to be
                    protected with cardboard or wooden boards and pasted over with paper. It was
                    also recommended that ceilings be further reinforced with wooden beams. Shelters
                    had to have at least one emergency exit. Each shelter had to be equipped with
                    electric lighting as well as an oil lamp and extra candles, with benches, dry
                    toilets (buckets with lids and sand), sand, water in enamel buckets, shovels,
                    crowbars, pickaxes and medical supplies. The walls of houses with shelters were
                    painted with recognizable symbols that also indicated shelter capacity. Building
                    interiors also had to be marked with symbols pointing towards the shelter.</p>

                    from the more mindful individuals: "I and anybody who has ever witnessed an air
                    raid anywhere simply cannot keep from being bewildered by the flippancy of the
                    people of Ljubljana, who, upon hearing an air raid alarm, act as if this was an
                    extraordinary piece of entertainment that is not to be missed. /.../. During the
                    most recent air raid alarm, I watched people who were extremely reluctant to
                    follow the instructions of security authorities to go to the public shelters.
                    /.../. I also saw people who, instead of heading for the house shelter upon
                    hearing the sirens, lingered behind their windows, looking inquisitively towards
                    the sky and with condescending disdain upon those who were hurrying towards the
                    shelters. /.../. So I urge all people of Ljubljana: upon hearing the air raid
                    alarm, go to the shelter, and no buts about it! Anyone who doesn't do this and
                    pays no heed to the warnings and instructions is criminally negligent of his own

                    gouging were felt by Slovenes as well. In the spring of 1940, their everyday
                    lives were marked by first supply shortages, and autumn of the same year saw the
                    introduction of the "regulated economy": Decrees aimed at controlling the prices
                    and stemming remorseless speculative trading were followed by a decree on meat
                    conservation in May 1940. The decree dictated two days of the week, Tuesday and
                    Friday, to be meatless days. On Tuesday and Friday, butchers were not allowed to
                    sell meat and restaurants were not allowed to prepare or serve dishes that
                    contained it. The authorities that drafted the decree were not completely
                    heartless, however, as butcher's shops and restaurants still offered lamb and
                    goat, poultry and venison throughout the week. In 1940, as the economic
                    situation was becoming increasingly tense in spite of attempts to stabilize it,
                    Ban <persName ref="#pers-NatlačenMarko">Marko Natlačen</persName> issued a
                    decree creating the Banate Institute of Food for Slovenia (Prevod), which was

                    Its creation (on 5 October 1940) meant that the principle of a wholly free
                    economy has been abandoned – and replaced by a planned economy. The principal
                    mission of Prevod was to foster a unified organization and execution of deals
                    aimed at supplying the people with the necessities of life. This rough draft of
                    a mission description included the following obligations: keeping stock of
                    supplies, procurement and control over distribution of the goods, and general
                    rationing control. Prevod was authorized to monitor price movements and the work
                    of salespeople as it was also in charge of fighting the black market. The
                    Institute had to organize and execute supply campaigns in order to renew the
                    stock of various comestibles in accordance with the decree on food reserves. All
                    this led to Prevod playing an important role in the supply of the population
                    once the war came to the Slovenian territory as well.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-252">The first interventions of the Institute, which were carried out
                    in collaboration with the highest instances of the banate, concerned wheat, as a
                    poor harvest (the Yugoslav harvest of 1940 was by as much as 100,000 railways
                    cars of grain lower than in 1939) resulted in a greatly increased demand. The
                    authorities tried to regulate the wheat and corn traffic with a decree
                    determining their highest possible prices at the producing end, requiring
                    inventory checks for all stocks and introducing a compulsory purchase policy
                    that benefited the major entities on the supply side.<note place="foot"

                    and bread ration cards, which the Drava Banate was then the first Yugoslav
                    banate to introduce in practice on 1 February 1941. The category of bread and
                    flour included pasta as well as other products made out of wheat or rye flour.
                    Food ration cards were available to people who did not own any land or owned
                    only as much as to still be exempt from paying the national land tax. Each
                    month, adults were entitled to 4 kg of wheat flour each and children to 2 kg (0
                    to 6 years) or 3 kg (6 to 14 years). Workers who performed heavy manual labour

                        below 6 received 2 kg of flour or 6.66 kg of bread per month, while children
                        from 6 to 14 received 3 kg of flour 10 kg of bread for their ration cards.

                    supply, which remained in use during the occupation, was updated numerous times
                    in the period from the summer of 1941 to the spring of 1945: an increasing
                    number of foodstuffs (not just flour, bread and pasta, but also meat, potatoes,
                    rice, milk, salt, sugar, oils and lard etc.) and other bare necessities (fuel,
                    soap, clothes, footwear, tobacco etc.) could only be purchased with ration cards
                    and also gradually declined in quality and available quantity.</p>

                    self-supply. City dwellers were advised to rent gardens, fields and meadows
                    (financially weaker families and families with many children were allowed to
                    rent free of charge), and some municipalities fostered the development of war
                    gardens (e.g. the biggest of such gardens in the capital was the Tivoli park
                    that encompassed 8,000 m² of cultivated area planted with potatoes and oats). In
                    addition to land cultivation, authorities tried to use public media and various
                    classes to introduce people to the keeping of small animals as those in power
                    realized this would allow many people to at least partly take care of their own
                    food supply and improve it without having to resort to the black market.<note

                        situation: black market flows between Ljubljana and Upper Carniola, which
                        were quite lively during the war, dried up completely in 1945. A few weeks
                        before the end of the war, the flow of black market foodstuffs
                        stopped.</note> In particular, the focus was on the raising of rabbits,

                    the end of the war, while for some locations, particularly cities that were cut
                    off from their hinterland or countryside due to transport interruptions, the
                    period from late 1944 to the liberation in May 1945 was a time of hunger.<note

                    the surviving internees. Before he arrived to Buchenwald, in the end of January
                    1945 Tamás had barely survived the internees' "death march", whom the Nazi
                    concentration camp guards had driven on as they retreated before the advancing
                    Soviet Army. His father had been one of the unfortunate fatalities of this
                    "death march". For months before that, Tamás and his fellow prisoners had
                    suffered the impossible working conditions in the Jawischowits (Polish:
                    Jawiszowice) coal mine, a branch of the infamous Auschwitz concentration camp.
                    Tamás had arrived there from Prekmurje already on 21 May 1944, together with his
                    mother, younger sister and other members of his family. On his arrival to
                    Auschwitz-Birkenau, Tamás had lied about his age, claiming to be sixteen years
                    old. Therefore the Nazi doctor <persName ref="#pers-MengeleJosef">Josef

                    benefit of the German Reich. Had the Allied Coalition not ultimately defeated
                    the Nazi Germany, Tamás would have sooner or later become a victim of the
                    colossal Nazi destruction machine. All of this just because he was Jewish.
                    During World War II the Nazi Germany, with eager assistance of its allies,
                    managed to eradicate two thirds (between five and six million) of Jewish people
                    from the occupied Nazi Europe. In comparison with the pre-war Jewish population,
                    more than 70 % of Jews in Poland, the Baltic region, Czechoslovakia, Greece and
                    the Netherlands died, and only slightly less in the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.
                    In contrast, in France, Bulgaria, Luxembourg and Italy around 20 % of the
                    pre-war Jewish population died, which means that despite the severe persecution

                    removing Jews from the territories controlled by Germany. Since the Nazis rose
                    to power in 1933 and until the breakout of World War II in 1939 the mass
                    deportation of Jews from Germany was the only possibility for the "final
                    solution of the Jewish question".<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn554" n="551">

                    radical anti-Jewish measures, Jews were gradually pushed out of the German
                    society and economy completely. Many of them were thus forced to leave Germany.
                    The German authorities literally forced Jews to emigrate, while at the same time
                    the vast majority of their assets were confiscated. After the German annexation
                    of Austria on 13 March 1938, Germany immediately started persecuting the
                    Austrian Jews as well. In just a few months the Austrian Jews experienced all of
                    the forms of persecution that the German Jews had been gradually subjected to in
                    the years leading up to that point.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn555" n="552"

                    until the end of 1938 virtually all of them sold their property below cost and
                    left Carinthia. Usually they were forced to leave for Vienna, where they waited
                    for the opportunity to leave the German Reich. The majority of these people
                    managed to leave in time, while the rest remained in the isolated houses,

                    where they mostly only stayed for a short time. Usually they headed on towards
                    Zagreb immediately or in a day or two, and then towards other corners of
                    Yugoslavia before finally retreating abroad. Many of these refugees were unable
                    to keep travelling, though, and they got stuck in Yugoslavia for various lengths
                    of time. With the aid of international Jewish organisations they were mostly
                    taken care of by the Yugoslav Jewish religious congregations. Quite a few of
                    these refugees were assigned to special shared accommodation. In 1940 the
                    authorities in Leskovec pri Krškem organised shared accommodation for refugees,

                    the Nazi authorities and take their property with them abroad. However, soon
                    even such Jewish refugees were no longer welcome. Thus the Czech Jew <persName

                    part of Slovenia for at least a decade, wanted to obtain Yugoslav citizenship.
                    At first most of them succeeded. However, as the persecution of Jews in the
                    Central Europe intensified, the responsible Yugoslav and Slovenian authorities
                    started refusing their applications more and more frequently, because of a
                    single reason: they were Jewish. Thus "the applicant is Jewish"<note

                    Some of the illegal refugees that the Yugoslav authorities captured were sent
                    back across the border. Only in a few cases did brave individuals prevent the

                    local driver then wanted to take them to the railway station in Radenci, but
                    they were captured by the gendarmerie on a bridge across the river Mura and

                <p xml:id="p-269">The German authorities were by no means happy to receive any
                    illegal Jewish refugees whom the Yugoslav authorities sent back across the
                    border. As World War II began, the number of countries where Jews, unwanted in
                    the German Reich, could seek refuge became increasingly slimmer. At the same
                    time, with new victories of the German war machine, the number of Jews living in
                    the territory of the expanded German Reich and in certain areas occupied by the
                    Germans, especially in Poland, increased very rapidly as well. Even though the
                    Nazi authorities continued to encourage the emigration of Jews from the German
                    Reich until as late as 1941, such a "solution of the Jewish question" turned out
                    to be increasingly unrealistic. The disenfranchised and destitute Jewish
                    population gradually became concentrated and enclosed in ghettos. The plan was
                    to deport and relocate them outside of the main territory of the German
                    jurisdiction at the first suitable opportunity. However, every new plan with
                    regard to the manner and location of their deportation (eastern Poland,
                    Madagascar, polar regions of the Soviet Union) soon went up in smoke. In the
                    circumstances of the ruthless German occupation policy, especially in Poland,
                    the local Nazi rulers implemented progressively radical policies against Jews
                    with the approval of their superiors. The lives of Jews became increasingly
                    threatened, but their methodical extermination did not (yet) occur.<note

                <p xml:id="p-271">On 6 April 1941, with the attack of the Axis Powers against
                    Yugoslavia, the full-blown Nazi persecution was also applied to Jews from the
                    Yugoslav Slovenia. After the defeat of the Yugoslav Army the German occupiers
                    took over the regions of Upper Carniola, Carinthia, Styria and the northern part
                    of Lower Carniola. These territories were then de facto (but not also de iure)
                    annexed by the German Reich. The other two occupiers annexed their parts of the
                    Slovenian territory also formally. The Italian occupiers took over most of Lower
                    Carniola, Inner Carniola and Ljubljana, where they established the provincial
                    administrative unit called the Ljubljana Province. The Hungarian occupiers took
                    over the majority of the Prekmurje region. The Hungarian legal order (and thus
                    the applicable anti-Jewish legislation) was soon implemented in Prekmurje, while
                    the German and Italian occupiers only gradually implemented their legal orders
                    in the occupied territories of Slovenia.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn571"

                    before World War II. The chart above demonstrates the growing and diminishing
                    number of the Jewish population in the Slovenian territory, occupied during
                    World War II by the German, Italian and Hungarian occupiers. The largest number
                    of Jews lived in Prekmurje, where they had begun to settle already in the 18<hi

                        rend="superscript">th</hi> century their number had already increased to
                    1000, but had diminished swiftly afterwards, especially due to their migration
                    to larger city centres outside of the economically poorly-developed Prekmurje
                    region. According to the last official population census in the Kingdom of
                    Yugoslavia, only 476 Jews were left in Prekmurje in 1931. The majority of them
                    had been firmly rooted in this territory for several generations, and therefore
                    almost all of them had Yugoslav citizenship. The Jewish community in the other
                    parts of the Slovenian territory was completely different. As it happened, after
                    the expulsion of Jews from Styria and Carinthia in 1497 and from Carniola in
                    1515 they were prohibited from permanently settling in this territory until as
                    late as their emancipation in 1867. However, even afterwards Jews only rarely
                    settled in these areas. Those who did were exceedingly urban, and the majority
                    of them only settled there recently. In 1937 almost half of Jews were foreign
                    citizens (from Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Germany and Romania).
                    If they were Yugoslav citizens, almost half of them had only recently arrived
                    from territories outside Slovenia as well, primarily from the neighbouring
                    Croatia. Before World War II most Jews lived in the larger cities, especially
                    Ljubljana, Maribor, Ptuj and Celje. Although they were, on average,
                    significantly wealthier as the rest of the population and certain quite rich
                    individuals were among them, the majority nevertheless belonged to the bourgeois
                    middle class. It was also characteristic for these Jews that they were
                    exceedingly mobile. During the 1931 census the interviewers only registered 344
                    Jews, but until the World War II their number gradually increased because of the
                    refugees. Thus, together with Christianised Jews, approximately one thousand
                    Jews lived in the territory of the Yugoslav Slovenia.<note place="foot"

                    Carniola were among those occupied territories (like the western Poland, Alsace
                    and Lorraine) that the Nazi elites wanted to Germanise as soon as possible. On
                    their quest for the "racially clean" German Reich, the Germans wanted to drive
                    out all of the "racially inferior" groups of the population and all those
                    individuals they saw as obstacles to Germanisation due to national and political
                    reasons. Not only did the Germans intend to banish the "racially inferior" Jews
                    and Romani, but rather, primarily, the part of the non-German population that
                    they did not intend to Germanise. The ambitiously outlined relocation plans

                    anti-Jewish policy took place. With the German attack against the Soviet Union a
                    total war began against the "Jewish Bolshevik" enemy. As the use of even the
                    most extreme measures was not only allowed but even recommended in the fight
                    against this enemy, the selective executions of Jewish men soon turned into
                    unselective extermination of the whole Jewish population. With mass shootings of
                    large groups of Jews the Germans and their collaborators managed to kill more
                    than a million Jews. Those who were not killed immediately were imprisoned in
                    crowded ghettos, where they awaited their destiny. Finally, by the beginning of
                    1942, the Nazi "solution of the Jewish question" developed into a systematic
                    industry of murder, killing millions of European Jews in the extermination

                <p xml:id="p-278">In light of these circumstances, in 1941 the Jewish refugees from
                    the Slovenian territory occupied by Germans managed to retreat to safety
                    temporarily. Most of them initially fled to Ljubljana, where they joined large
                    numbers of other Jewish refugees. In the end of August 1941 over 400 Jewish
                    refugees from the Slovenian Styria and Upper Carniola, Germany, Austria, and
                    more and more often from Croatia were located in Ljubljana. Usually they did not
                    intend to stay in Ljubljana for long, but rather headed onwards to Italy.
                    Despite the strict Italian anti-Jewish legislation Italy was an attractive
                    destination for the refugees fleeing from the Nazi persecution. Until 1943 the
                    level of the Italian anti-Jewish violence was extremely benign in comparison
                    with the Nazi Germany. Jewish refugees and other Jews with foreign citizenship,
                    also those in the Ljubljana Province, were soon subject to internment in Italy
                    in accordance with the Italian racial legislation.<note place="foot"

                    had lived in Ljubljana for a long time, were interned as well. When Italy
                    capitulated in September 1943, only a small number of foreign Jews and those
                    with the former Yugoslav citizenship, among them many Christianised Jews or
                    those living in mixed marriages, remained in Ljubljana.</p>

                    the concentration camps. Some of the Italian Jewish communities were virtually
                    decimated. The situation was the worst for those who ended up under direct
                    German authority in the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral. At least 764
                    members of the Jewish community in Trieste, which had amounted to more than 3500
                    people in 1942, died during the Holocaust. Of more than one hundred Jews from
                    Gorizia, 45 died in the concentration camps.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn582"

                <p xml:id="p-280">At this time the Holocaust also engulfed the Hungarian Jews and
                    thus the Jews in Prekmurje. Hungarians implemented a strict anti-Jewish policy
                    in the Prekmurje region, similarly as elsewhere in Hungary, but they did not
                    carry out the Holocaust until as late as 1944. This dramatic turn of events in
                    Prekmurje as well as elsewhere in Hungary took place only after the deployment
                    of the German troops on 19 March 1944 and the establishment of a pro-German
                    government there. This was followed by systematic arrests, concentration of Jews
                    in ghettos and their subsequent transportation to the concentration camps by the
                    Germans. The Prekmurje Jews were among the first victims. In April 1944 the
                    Hungarian authorities arrested 387 Jews, transported them through Čakovec to the
                    temporary Jewish ghetto in Nagykanizsa, and from there to Auschwitz-Birkenau. On
                    20 October 1944 the few remaining Jews, who had been spared before, were
                    arrested together with a large group of Slovenians.<note place="foot"

                    Thus only 63 members of the once largest Slovenian pre-war Jewish community
                    survived the Holocaust. Quite the opposite, the majority of Jews arrested in
                    Ljubljana in 1944 returned from the concentration camps. Similarly, most of the
                    Jewish refugees who had fled to Italy managed to survive as well. These
                    surviving Jewish refugees, who were mostly without a Yugoslav citizenship,
                    rarely returned to Slovenia after the war. The few of them who returned home
                    after the war usually soon left Yugoslavia, mostly for Israel.</p>

                    population in different periods. However, the severity of the persecution, which
                    finally led to the genocide of the Jewish population, was more or less the same
                    as in the case of all other European Jews:</p>

                        1938; and in Yugoslavia in 1940.</item>
                    <item>In order to get rid of them, the authorities initially encouraged the

                        from the persecution thus sought refuge elsewhere, also in Slovenia.
                        However, with the occupation of Slovenia in April 1941 they started running
                        towards Italy in increasingly large numbers.</item>
                    <item>When this forced emigration came to an almost complete stop, the Jews from

                        Jews would have been killed in the concentration camps.</item>

                    for the so-called Second Yugoslavia, a state established during World War II as
                    the successor of the First Yugoslavia. The Second Yugoslavia was also referred
                    to as the AVNOJ Yugoslavia, as it was in fact created as a federally organised
                    state at the session of the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of
                    Yugoslavia (AVNOJ) in the end of November 1943. At that time this previously
                    political body of the Yugoslav liberation movement assumed a governmental,
                    authority role as a legislative body. Thus a government change – a revolution in
                    the political and legal field – was carried out in Yugoslavia. The name refers
                    to this state throughout its existence, until its dissolution in the end of 1991
                    (or 1992, as each of the independent national states, emerging from the former
                    Yugoslav parts, sees the end of the Yugoslav state differently, from its own
                    viewpoint). However, the collocation can also describe the state in the time
                    when it was led by <persName ref="#pers-BrozJosipTito">Josip Broz
                        Tito</persName> (born in 1892, died in 1980). After <persName

                    another decade. However, this period was characterised by an economic and
                    political crisis, which was largely a consequence of the preceding time when he
                    was still alive, controlling all the aspects of the state politics. After
                        <persName ref="#pers-BrozJosipTito">Tito's</persName> death the main
                    characteristics, forming in the development of the Yugoslav state until that
                    time, started accumulating, and due to the inability to address these issues
                    they ultimately caused this state's end.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-284">Several periods can be distinguished in the periodisation of the
                    Second Yugoslavia (1943/45–1991/92). Usually the reasons for the transition from
                    one period to another were political in nature, and the developments in the
                    economy should also be understood as developments in a certain area of politics
                    or as a consequence of political decisions. By all means, one of the possible
                    turning points that characterised the Yugoslav state is the death of its
                    President (leader with many political functions) <persName

                    in Yugoslavia without <persName ref="#pers-BrozJosipTito">Tito</persName> –
                    after <persName ref="#pers-BrozJosipTito">Tito</persName> – was different than
                    before. It was the time of the "gradual death" of the state which <persName
                        ref="#pers-BrozJosipTito">Tito</persName> had represented in the world. This
                    decline took place over slightly more than a decade, and in this time <persName
                        ref="#pers-BrozJosipTito">Tito's</persName> Yugoslavia went through a
                    profound crisis of all the elements it consisted of and was characterised by.
                    During <persName ref="#pers-BrozJosipTito">Tito's</persName> lifetime Yugoslavia
                    was different than after his death, regardless of the fact that it was the same
                    state with all of the manifestations and characteristics that a state can have.
                        <persName ref="#pers-BrozJosipTito">Tito's</persName> era was the period of
                    Yugoslav development, and the time after his death was the period of its
                    decline.</p>
                <milestone unit="subchapter" n="I" xml:id="milestone-7"/>
                <p xml:id="p-285">During World War II new authorities were established
                    simultaneously with the resistance against the occupiers, who had divided the
                    Yugoslav territory. This implied a political revolution. The new Yugoslav
                    authorities, established by the resistance – the liberation movement – were
                    headed by the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia
                    (AVNOJ), which passed the decision on the establishment of a federal state – in
                    contrast with the centralist system of the First Yugoslavia. The First
                    Yugoslavia refused to acknowledge the existence of different nations, and only
                    recognised a single Yugoslav nation. The AVNOJ postponed the question of the
                    government's form – whether Yugoslavia would be a monarchy or a republic – for
                    the time after the war: the people would decide by voting at elections. During
                    the war the political system and the so-called class-based social changes were
                    not discussed, but they were planned for.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-286">The takeover of power during the war was accepted and in fact
                    recognised by the Western Allies as well, mostly due to the military efficiency
                    of the Yugoslav Partisans in the struggle against the common enemy – the Nazi
                    Germany, even if the Allies were in principle reserved if not outright hostile
                    towards the communists. When they assumed control after the war, the communists,
                    on the basis of an agreement with the King's government, initially shared the
                    power with the pre-war, so-called bourgeois politicians. This situation lasted
                    only until the autumn of 1945, when these politicians assumed the role of the
                    opposition. They refused to appear at the Constitutional Assembly elections,
                    which had plebiscitary implications for the new authorities, also with regard to
                    the issue of the form of government. The bourgeois politicians realised that the
                    political struggle with the communists, appearing in the form of the People's
                    Front organisation (which, apart from the communists, also included various
                    political and ideological groups, sharing the values that the liberation
                    movement had fought for during the war), was in fact unequal and lost for them.
                    The government of Yugoslavia was taken over by the communists, who established a
                    system of people's democracy, although with a different structure and character
                    than in the countries liberated by the Red Army.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-287">The essence of the Second Yugoslavia was declared by its official
                    state names: as far as the form of government was concerned, it was a republic;
                    according to state organisation it was a federal state, a federation; and it had
                    a socialist political system. This system was initially "concealed" with the
                    name "people's democracy", even though it was obviously a system led, if not
                    completely dominated, by the communists. In view of the official name of the
                    Yugoslav state, the emphasis was initially placed on the state organisation –
                    the federal character – as an essential and internationally recognised
                    achievement of the revolution that had been carried out. The political system or
                    government representing this federation was in the second place. Thus the state
                    was, in 1946, named the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia (FLRJ). Its
                    federal character implied the recognition of the individual nations as well as
                    the right of these nations to their own self-determination. The primary emphasis
                    of the second official name for this state was its political system – socialism.
                    It was called the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRJ, 1963). The
                    second Yugoslav state was a combination of the national and class-related
                    outlook of the Yugoslav communists.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-288">The "national" principle of the state – its federal character –
                    was also depicted in the state's coat-of-arms. Initially – until the 1963
                    Constitution – this coat-of-arms included five burning torches, representing the
                    individual nations; and subsequently six torches, representing their national
                    states. The federal units of the federal state were called "republics". In both
                    versions of the coat-of-arms the flames of the individual torches merged into a
                    single flame on the top.</p>

                <p xml:id="p-289">With the end of the war the new state authorities started
                    consolidating their position in all the aspects of life. The so-called second
                    stage of the revolution began. It was class-oriented in character, and its
                    intention was to provide the foundations for the communist rule. The revolution
                    was implemented in an evolutionary manner.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-290">The first essential change in the political field took place on 29
                    November 1945. On this day the Constitutional Assembly, elected at the elections
                    on 11 November with the victory of the People's Front, declared a new form of
                    government in Yugoslavia: a republic. The elections and the declaration of the
                    republic were also acknowledged by the Western superpowers, which were otherwise
                    quite reserved towards and critical of the new authorities and the new form of
                    government. Two months later, on 31 January 1946, the Constitutional Assembly
                    adopted the Constitution of the FLRJ. During the drafting of this Constitution
                    minor disputes, especially between the Slovenian and Serbian members of the
                    Assembly, were noticeable with regard to the change of the state organisation,
                    its federal character, and thus the resolution of the national question. The
                    disputes involved the interpretation of the principle of the nations' right to
                        self-determination.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn585" n="582">

                    Germans who had been Yugoslav citizens before the war was especially significant
                    for the state. The expropriation of these Germans and people who had opposed the
                    liberation movement during the war was referred to as "patriotic
                    nationalisation", on the basis of the so-called patriotic motives. Primarily
                    this nationalisation was not carried out due to class reasons, but as punishment
                    for opposing the liberation movement. On the basis of "patriotic
                    nationalisation", until the end of 1946 the majority of large economic
                    undertakings became the property of the state. This form of nationalisation was
                    followed by the "frontal", class-based "attack" against private property. The
                    process was called nationalisation, as the foreign capital was the first to be
                    nationalised by the state. It took place in two stages. The first stage involved
                    primarily the nationalisation of the considerable capital of the owners from the
                    Allied and neutral states. At the second stage, in 1948,<note place="foot"

                    authorities were carried out until the beginning of 1947. The 1946 Constitution
                    of the Yugoslav state was, in many aspects, modelled after <hi rend="italic">the
                        1936 Soviet Constitution, also known as the <persName
                            ref="#pers-StalinJosifVisarionovič">Stalin</persName> Constitution.
                        Subsequently all the federal units of the federal Yugoslav state</hi>
                    adopted their own constitutions as well. However, these were only "transcripts"
                    of the Yugoslav Constitution. A year after the adoption of the Yugoslav
                    Constitution, the Slovenian Constitutional Assembly adopted the Constitution of
                    the People's Republic of Slovenia. Thus the new position of Slovenia in the
                    Yugoslav state was confirmed and implemented. According to this Constitution
                    Slovenia had a sovereign state authority in its territory, and it transferred
                    the rights set out by the Yugoslav Constitution to the federal state. The powers
                    of the federal – central – authorities were considerable. In practice the
                    federal principle was subordinated to administrative centralism. The federal
                    character manifested itself as a partial administrative autonomy of the
                    individual republics.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-293">According to the principle of the federal system of the Yugoslav
                    state, the Republic of Slovenia, like all the other republics, had its own
                    legislative body, the Assembly, its own government, as well as its own national
                    communist organisation, which had been established in 1937. However, despite all
                    of the Slovenian bodies of state authority the most important politics was
                    created and managed in Belgrade, in accordance with revolutionary statism and
                    centralism. Slovenia only enjoyed considerable independence in the field of
                    culture and education, as no federal ministries existed for these areas. In this
                    sense the nations were independent, while the central authorities or the federal
                    ministries were in charge of all other aspects of the functioning of the state
                    and the lives of the Yugoslav citizens. In the first post-war period the
                    opposition between the federal principle and centralist practice did not appear
                    to be problematic. However, this became an issue during the subsequent
                    development of the Yugoslav political system, as this development was based on
                    self-management and the Marxist idea about the decline of the state and the
                    principle of sharing the so-called products of labour: that those who produce
                    something should benefit from the economic results of their labour. The
                    opposition between federalism, which emphasised a greater role of the republics
                    in the decisions about their own development policies on the basis of what they
                    produce, and centralism became the source of political disputes in Yugoslavia.
                    The Slovenian politics supported federalism.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-294">The issue of federalism resulted in the division into economically
                    developed and underdeveloped republics. The economically-developed republics
                    (Slovenia, Croatia), which argued in favour of federalism, produced more and
                    invested (or could have invested) into their own development. On the other hand,
                    the underdeveloped republics supported centralism, as they benefitted from the
                    central political allocation of resources for their own development, which they
                    were otherwise unable to produce on their own.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-295">Immediately after the war the centralism of state administration
                    was substantiated as an urgent measure in order to ensure the much-needed
                    restoration and development. It was outlined in the sense of the Soviet planned
                    economy, i.e. as a five-year plan. Such a plan could only be centralised and
                    managed administratively. The "Soviet" model of centralism remained in force
                    until the beginning of the 1950s, when the so-called Cominform dispute caused
                    Yugoslavia to start searching for its own version of socialism. Such a version
                    was found in self-management and embodied in the so-called 4D process:
                    destatisation, debureaucratisation, decentralisation, and democratisation.
                    Despite its good intentions, this comprehensive process was not very successful.
                    The statism practice, connected with bureaucratisation and centralism, remained
                    largely the same as before. Apart from the conviction that centralism was a
                    precondition for a strong state, one of the key reasons for it was also the
                    modelling after the organisation of the ruling (sole) political party, the
                    Communist Party. The Party was strictly centralist in terms of its organisation
                    and leadership. While the state was continuously federalised and ultimately
                    turned into a federal state (according to its name rather than anything else: in
                    reality it was much more like a union of states), the Communist Party remained
                    centralised. The reason for this was the conviction that the Party and the
                    working class this Party (supposedly) represented were the main substance of the
                    state, which called for the centralism of its decision-making process.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-296">Centralism with a prominent role of state administration, the
                    so-called statism, was all-powerful until the middle of the 1950s. At that time
                    the "struggle" for the reduction of administrative centralism and the
                    strengthened position and role of the republics in relation to the federal state
                    authorities began due to the orientation towards diminishing the role and power
                    of the state and its administration. The political struggle between centralism
                    and federalism, which became evident at the end of the 1950s, characterised the
                    political developments in Yugoslavia until its very end. In fact, the demise of
                    Yugoslavia occurred primarily due to the differences in the understanding of
                    centralism and federalism as well as the basic conditions of federalism:
                    recognition of the right to the self-determination of nations.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-297">In Yugoslavia the implementation of a new political system, the
                    so-called people's democracy – a blend of the communist system and certain
                    characteristics of a parliamentary democracy, including the multi-party system –
                    began towards the end of the war. Unlike the countries liberated by the Soviet
                    Army, in Yugoslavia the Communist Party had already assumed all of the political
                    power during the struggle for the liberation of the state. In other people's
                    democracies, where the revolution had not been carried out under the communist
                    leadership, the process of the communist domination was somewhat slower and
                    dictated from Moscow. Another aspect, important for the power of the Yugoslav
                    Communist Party, was also the fact that it was pan-Yugoslav and that the
                    independence of the national Communist Parties was limited: they were integral
                    parts of the uniformly organised Yugoslav Party. In the political life the
                    Communist Party, which was not even officially registered in line with the
                    legislation authored by the communists themselves, appeared as the People's
                    Front until the summer of 1948. Despite this mimicry, Yugoslavia was a so-called
                    Party state. The Party leadership equalled the state leadership. In terms of
                    personnel, the Party and governmental functions went hand in hand at all levels
                    of the government. The state organisation largely resembled the organisation of
                    the Communist Party, and the decisions of the Communist Party were critically
                    important for the state government.</p>

                    contemporaneous events as well as for the further Yugoslav development. It began
                    as criticism "between comrades", with <persName

                    Yugoslav Party and state leadership as well as their policies, which were

                    not accept. Due to <persName ref="#pers-StalinJosifVisarionovič"

                    themselves to him, which was something that the Yugoslav leaders were not
                    prepared to do, the dispute between the Soviet and Yugoslav Party and state
                    leadership attained a broader dimension, as <persName
                        ref="#pers-StalinJosifVisarionovič">Stalin</persName> spread this dispute to
                    the whole of his political bloc. The countries under <persName

                    hostile towards Yugoslavia, and due to their military threat Yugoslavia started
                    turning towards the West in terms of military equipment and technology. It left
                    the Soviet Bloc, but did not enter the Western Bloc due to its political
                    orientation. However, because of its resistance against <persName

                    by the West.</p>

                        >Stalin's</persName> model. The ideological disagreement with the other
                    Communist Parties and the resulting search for an original form of socialism led
                    to the introduction of workers' self-management. Swiftly – in just a few years –
                    this model, implemented as worker's self-management in June 1950, became the
                    foundation of the Yugoslav political system. After the initial enthusiasm, as
                    the worker's self-management was an alternative to <persName

                    its implementation became subject to disapproval. It turned out that the
                    abandonment of the previous practices (especially centralism and the
                    introduction of different relations between the republics and the federal
                    government on the basis of the principle of payment according to one's work or

                    self-management believed that this model may have demonstrated that socialism
                    could be different from the Soviet system, but that in light of the
                    normalisation of the relations with the Soviet Union after <persName

                    longer necessary as a political tool for foreign affairs. Those who believed
                    this were also convinced that self-management was inefficient in comparison with
                    the previous socialist system, which emphasised the power of the state and its
                    central authorities.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-300">The political developments in Yugoslavia in the middle of the
                    1950s were strongly influenced by the aspirations for national unitarianism,
                    calling for the denial of the certain rights of the nations or suggesting that
                    these rights should no longer be paid much attention to. This gave rise to the
                    so-called national question or the question of the existence of the nations as
                    an essential condition for the Yugoslav federalism as well as to the question of
                    the existence of the republics as national states. The opening of such questions
                    resulted in the emphases that differences existed between the Yugoslav nations,
                    caused by the differences in their development. The issue of upgrading the
                    self-management model at the local and state level also arose, as
                    self-management transcended the factories and was no longer merely a matter of
                    the workers. To a considerable degree, these developments had the character of

                    According to the Yugoslav Party leaders the League of Communists was not a
                    political party, but rather an association of politically and ideologically
                    likeminded people, which only steered and led the country with its ideas, "by

                    and position of the Communist Party only remained on paper, while in practice
                    the League of Communists was a classic ruling Communist Party. Due to the
                    various interpretations of the new role of the Communist Party, disagreements
                    occurred in the top-level Yugoslav Party leadership. When the People's Front was
                    renamed as well – it became the Socialist Alliance of Working People (SAWP =
                    SZDL) – one of the Party ideologists, <persName ref="#pers-DjilasMilovan"
                        >Milovan Djilas</persName>, saw this as an opportunity for political
                    "pluralism" (the multi-party system may have been allowed by law, but it was
                    unwanted in practice). The Socialist Alliance of Working People would supposedly
                    take the place previously occupied by the Party in the government, while the
                    Party would actually become the leading ideological force. The so-called first
                    Party liberalism was formed. Since <persName ref="#pers-DjilasMilovan"
                        >Djilas</persName>, due to such considerations, questioned the untouchable
                    nature of the Party, as he rejected the "Leninist" principle of the Communist
                    Party (which was what the League of Communists remained, despite the declarative
                    changes), he was "removed" from the Party and state leadership. Initially he
                    became "politically retired". However, because he criticised the policy of his
                    former comrades, he was sentenced to several years in prison.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-302">In the political field, in the beginning of 1953 the constitution
                    was changed as well. A Constitutional Act was adopted, but due to the
                    introduction of self-management into the constitutional system it contained so
                    many amendments it was in fact a new constitution. Self-management became the
                    political foundation of the state system. The new constitution was more
                    class-oriented. It referred to socialism instead of people's democracy, and the
                    assembly of producers was introduced into the legislative bodies at all levels.
                    Less attention was paid to the federal nature of the state organisation. The
                    authors of the Constitutional Act referred to the united Yugoslav working class,
                    which hinted at the possibility of national unitarianism and centralism. Placing
                    the emphasis on the class for the purpose of self-management stirred awake the
                    sleeping volcano: the national question. Due to the class aspect, the "common
                    Yugoslav awareness" would supposedly be formed, pushing out the national aspect.
                    Centralism as well as national unitarianism was a very tempting possibility for
                    some, especially the Serbs. Such reasoning soon brought up the question of the
                    role and position of the republics in the federation. At the same time, in view
                    of the divergent economic development and economic situation, the question of
                    the relations between the republics arose. It manifested itself through the
                    relations between the developed and underdeveloped: in the issue of who
                    benefitted more from the federation and who exploited whom in the economic
                    sense. Because of the dissimilar outlooks on the role of the Yugoslav "centre",
                    the conflicts also became evident in the Yugoslav party-state leadership. Some
                    of the Party leaders argued for the enhancement of self-management and
                    decentralisation (among them <persName ref="#pers-KardeljEdvard">Edvard
                        Kardelj</persName>, the leading Slovenian politician in the Yugoslav Party
                    and state leadership, author of constitutions and Party ideologist); while
                    others argued for a stronger central authority and integration in all aspects
                    (this opinion was represented by the Serbian politician <persName
                        ref="#pers-RankovićAleksander">Aleksandar Ranković</persName>, Party
                    organisational secretary and head of the political police). The President of the
                    State and General Secretary of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, <persName
                        ref="#pers-BrozJosipTito">Josip Broz-Tito</persName>, leaned towards the
                    centralist side. Two blocs formed: the federalists and centralists, or the
                    developed and underdeveloped. This situation persisted until the very end of
                    Yugoslavia and was one of the key reasons for its demise.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-303">Self-management was another generator of the national question. In
                    1955 the so-called communal system was introduced, bestowing not only
                    administrative, but also political jurisdictions on the local communities
                    (municipalities as the smallest administrative units). The communes were to
                    assume certain functions of the state, and would function as the means for the
                    "withering of the state". Those who wanted to overcome the division of
                    Yugoslavia into national republics saw the communes as a possibility for the
                    abolishment of the national republics and transformation of Yugoslavia into a
                    "federation" of communes. According to them, in this way the national principle
                    of the federation would be abolished, allowing for the fusion into unitarian
                    Yugoslavism. Certain hints with regard to the abolishment of the national
                    republics were also stated at the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Congress of
                    the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in April 1958. <persName
                        ref="#pers-KardeljEdvard">Kardelj</persName> stood up against such way of
                    thinking and argued for the preservation of the national or republican principle
                    of the Yugoslav federation. At the same time he resolutely rejected the
                    Slovenian national egoism.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-304">Different views were also apparent in the political evaluation of
                    the so-called Trbovlje Strike. At the beginning of 1958 the miners of the
                    largest coal mines in Slovenia went on strike (the first acknowledged workers'
                    strike in Yugoslavia after World War II). The main reason were the inadequate
                    salaries, resulting from the difference between the centrally dictated price of
                    coal and costs of extracting coal in the Slovenian coal mines. Here the costs
                    were higher than in the other Yugoslav coal mines. The miners blamed the
                    Belgrade authorities for their meagre salaries. However, despite these social
                    foundations, the strike was a political demonstration against the administrative
                    management of the economic system and expression of the sentiment that Slovenia
                    was economically neglected. The political evaluation of the strike in the
                    Yugoslav Party leadership opened a discussion about the relations between the
                    republics and the federation as well as about the mutual relations of the
                    republics. This issue became a permanent feature of the Yugoslav domestic
                    policy.</p>

                    relations between the republics were caused by the different outlooks on the
                    role of the federal government, the republics, and the development of
                    self-management as a way of diminishing the importance of the central state
                    authorities. This, along with poor economic management, was the reason for the
                    convening of the three-day session of the Party leadership in the middle of
                    March 1962. At this session <persName ref="#pers-KardeljEdvard"

                    federalism and self-management; nevertheless, he was supported by the Slovenian
                    political leadership. The session failed to appease the disagreements, but it
                    announced a stricter policy. The political "battle" at the time was won by the
                    centralists, which was also evident from the constitution, adopted in April
                    1963. This constitution, also called The Self-Management Charter, defined
                    self-management constitutionally. The state got a new name, clearly pointing out
                    the socialist orientation of Yugoslavia (Socialist Federal Republic of
                    Yugoslavia), while a step back was taken with regard to its federalism and the

                    Yugoslav federation should be reformed by increasing the role of the republics.
                    In November 1965 he proposed the complete sovereignty of the republics, while
                    the federal government would only have the role of a technical instrument. He

                    relations in the Yugoslav state. The political police – State Security
                    Administration, popularly referred to as UDBA (Serbien: Uprava državne
                    bezbednosti = UDB) – lost some of its political power, while the power of the

                    consequences were also apparent in the state organisation. Only four years after
                    its adoption, the constitution was amended.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-308">Meanwhile, a thorough economic reform was implemented in 1965, but
                    it was unsuccessful and dwindled to nothing after a few years without yielding
                    any concrete and long-term results. However, the reform of the state
                    organisation began. The Yugoslav federation was "federalised" as the
                    jurisdictions of the republics increased. In the end of 1968 a few amendments
                    were made to the Yugoslav constitution. These constitutional amendments
                    primarily altered the structure and powers of the Federal Assembly as well as
                    more precisely defined the autonomous provinces in the context of Serbia:
                    Vojvodina and Kosovo. The Assembly of Nations – consisting of an equal number of
                    deputies from each of the republics and half as many deputies from the two
                    autonomous provinces – was introduced in the Federal Assembly. Thus outvoting on
                    the basis of the republican adherence of the deputies would be prevented. In the
                    middle of 1971, 23 additional amendments to the SFRJ Constitution, thus 42
                    altogether, were adopted, which means that the Constitution was thoroughly
                    changed. The constitutional amendments also largely solved the crisis of
                    federalism, which had been apparent already since the beginning of the 1960s and
                    had also not been addressed by the 1963 Constitution. These federal amendments
                    redefined the Yugoslav federation. Both autonomous provinces in the context of
                    Serbia became constituent parts of the federal state. Republics were defined as
                    "states, founded on the sovereignty of the nations", which was an expression of
                    a greater independence of the republics and their position in the federal
                        state.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn594" n="591">

                    political arena, started developing and strengthening after the middle of the
                    1960s. Most demands for the liberalisation of the relations in the Yugoslav
                    state and society stemmed from the much-needed changes in the economy,
                    especially the requirement for the greater role of the market and introduction
                    of the market-planned economy, which, in turn, called for changes of the
                    political system. It was supposed to become more democratic, and the political
                    power was to be decentralised, thus ensuring the increased role of the

                    republics and had various characteristics, depending on the particular local
                    situation. All "liberals" shared a critical outlook on the contemporaneous way
                    of thinking and leadership as well as on the position of the League of
                    Communists in the state and society. Changes were demanded even with regard to
                    this essential aspect of the Yugoslav state.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-310">It was characteristic for "liberalism" that its advocates did not
                    wish to change the political system of socialist self-management, but rather
                    address the way in which it operated. They argued for a stricter separation
                    between the Party and the state as well as for more democracy within the Party
                    itself. They believed that the criticism of certain elements of Party activities
                    would also ensure a reform of the political and economic regime. As far as the
                    relations between the Yugoslav nations and the organisation of the federal state
                    were concerned, "liberalism" especially underlined the importance of a greater
                    independence of the republics. The "liberals" understood the relationship with
                    the federation as a greater independence of the republics, especially in the
                    field of investments. With certain investments – the so-called participation
                    fees – the republics themselves would finance the necessary activities of the
                    federal state, without the federal government specifying what and where they
                    should invest. The republics were supposed to have more influence and freedom
                    with regard to their own development.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-311">The central figure of "liberalism" in Slovenia was <persName

                    Executive Committee – Slovene government. In Slovenia, the main ideas about the
                    urgency of liberalisation – not only of the Party, but, even more so, of the
                    political and economic life – were created among the younger generation of
                    social sciences experts. <persName ref="#pers-KavčičStane">Kavčič</persName> and
                    his associates argued for a swifter development of the service and energy
                    industry in the economy, as well as for the introduction of other forms of
                    ownership apart from the predominantly social property, for example
                    shareholding. Furthermore, they wanted to ensure an improved functioning of the
                    so-called market economy and emphasised the importance of establishing
                    connections between the Slovenian economy and the neighbouring and West European
                    countries.</p>

                    as its understanding of the relations between the republics and the state centre
                    became most obvious during the so-called Road Affair in the summer of 1969.The
                    "Road Affair" was the clearest manifestation of the aspirations for the
                    "liberalisation" of the relations in the Yugoslav state and the Slovenian
                    society. This was an open resistance of Slovenia and its government against the
                    federation or the Yugoslav government. The affair broke out in the end of July
                    1969 as a reaction to a decision of the Yugoslav government that Slovenia
                    disagreed with. As it happened, the Yugoslav government (with <persName

                    President) did not allocate the loan from the International Bank for
                    Development, intended for the construction of motorways in Yugoslavia, to the
                    construction of a motorway in Slovenia. When the Slovenian government found out
                    about this decision – not even officially, but rather from a short news agency
                    item in the newspapers – a political "storm" broke out in Slovenia, despite the
                    summer and holidays. Not only the Slovenian state and Party leadership, but also
                    the people responded to the decision of the Yugoslav government. Their reaction
                    was emotional, critical of the central authorities as well as of the Yugoslav
                    state in general. Individual posters appeared, even calling for an independent
                    Slovenia. Demands were made that Slovenian deputies in the Federal Assembly
                    should "consider the possibility of resignation or questioning their further
                    confidence in the Federal Executive Committee in case of extreme lack of

                    the Slovenian political leadership between the liberally-oriented state

                    popularity of the "liberals" among the people, the hard-line side of the Party
                    took the initiative. In this political conflict, "liberalism" was defeated.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-315">The political offensive against "liberalism" at the Yugoslav level
                    began in the end of 1971, when the Croatian "liberals" were removed politically,
                    and reached its peak in the autumn of 1972 with the removal of the "liberals" in
                    Slovenia and Serbia. In the end of September 1972, <persName
                        ref="#pers-BrozJosipTito">Tito</persName> sent a letter to the members of
                    the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, warning them that due to "liberalism"
                    the very fate of socialism in Yugoslavia was at stake. Therefore the communists
                    – whom he characterised as soldiers of the revolution – should strengthen their
                    activities. He called upon them to defend socialism without the changes that the
                    "liberals" argued for. Those who did not agree with this completely would get in
                    trouble. Thus a political reorientation towards the left was carried out, a sort
                    of a pseudo-revolution. The class aspects became increasingly important. The
                    Party monopoly was restored and the Yugoslav society endured the
                    "proletarisation" in all areas, with the emphasis on the political system of
                    socialist self-management. The period of a significant ideological as well as
                    practical pressure of the League of Communists against the society began. This

                <p xml:id="p-317">The increasing class tensions were noticeable in all aspects of
                    the political or social life. The restriction of the already achieved level of
                    democratisation and freedoms intensified as well. The Party carried out a
                    "purge", and the political cleansing spread to the fields of culture, science,
                    and even economy. Many leading economists who wanted to enhance the functioning
                    of the so-called free market had to leave their positions. The already attained
                    level of political debates was reduced as the courts once again started
                    sanctioning any critical deliberations more severely. The oppression of
                    "liberalism" and "the liberals" also took place at the Yugoslav universities,
                    especially in Zagreb and Belgrade. At the Belgrade University some critics even
                    received prison sentences. In Slovenia, four professors at the Faculty of
                    Sociology, Politology and Journalism (now Faculty of Social Sciences) were
                    accused of failing to lecture in the spirit of Marxism. They were not
                    imprisoned, but they were forbidden from working with students.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-318">In February 1974 a new constitution of the SFRJ was adopted, and
                    all of the republics adopted their own constitutions as well. The 1974
                    Constitution – one of the longest in the world with its 406 articles – had a
                    twofold character. On one hand it strengthened the federal nature of the state
                    to such a degree that the critics of the constitutional system at the time (most
                    of them were Serbian politicians) believed that this Constitution introduced a
                    confederate Yugoslavia. Because the republics became states in the
                    constitutional sense, supposedly Yugoslavia was no longer a federal state, but
                    rather a union of states. On the other hand the new Constitution intensified the
                    class-based elements of the Yugoslav society and state. Its main purpose was to
                    address the question of classes in the Yugoslav society, as the class relations
                    – the single Yugoslav working class – were supposedly the assurance for the
                    state community, its unity and its existence in general. Therefore the
                    Constitution placed considerable emphasis on self-management and the so-called
                    associated labour, which was the name for the integration of "free producers"
                    (the working class) at all levels – from labour organisation to the state level.
                    The so-called delegate system was introduced with the aim of ensuring that the
                    representative bodies did not consist of elected professionals, or permanent
                    Members of the Assembly. This would supposedly de-professionalise politics and
                    "hand it over" to the citizens. Classic elections were abolished due to the
                    conviction that they resembled parliamentary elections too closely. In the
                    delegate system everything was based on elected delegates, who then went on to
                    elect (from their own ranks) the delegates for the "higher" levels, up to the
                    Federal Assembly. The delegate of delegates was "at the top". In the second half
                    of the 1970s, when the delegate system became fully functional, around 200,000
                    people in Slovenia – more than one tenth of the population or every fourth
                    employee – were involved in delegations at various levels. The functioning of
                    the delegate Assembly system turned out to be complicated, expensive, as well as
                    inefficient. In practice it became apparent that the decisions, adopted by the
                    delegates, were, as a rule, first agreed upon in the League of Communists. The
                    new Constitution in fact represented a victory of the conservative forces in the
                    Yugoslav state and Party leadership. The "federalisation" of the federation was
                    seen as confederalisation in Serbia, for example. It is also what the Serbian
                    national ideologue, writer <persName ref="#pers-ĆosićDobrica">Dobrica

                    the enhancement of federalism by increasing the role and position of the
                    republics in comparison with the "centre" as the disintegration of

                    and then in the 1974 Constitution. These very changes became the focus of
                    criticism and aspirations for changes in the time after <persName

                    Yugoslav federal state began.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-319">The Constitution was especially criticised by those who believed
                    it established an excessively loose state organisation. The Yugoslav state in
                    fact became a union of six or eight states, as the autonomous provinces in the
                    context of Serbia had virtually the same position as the republics. The
                    Constitution was criticised most resolutely in Serbia, and the military
                    leadership did not support it either. The military was troubled especially
                    because the Constitution provided for the Territorial Defence as a part of the
                    Yugoslav forces, organised in the individual republics and answering to the
                    republican political leaderships. In the opinion of the military leadership this
                    paved the way for the emergence of republican armies.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-320">The 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Congress of the League of
                    Communists of Yugoslavia was convened soon after the adoption of the
                    Constitution, in order to demonstrate the significance and power of the
                    Communist Party. Its importance and political power was not only declarative: it
                    was real. The new Constitution ensured the Party monopoly, and in practice the
                    Party started acting as an all-powerful ruling force. This suited the Party
                    conservatives and the Party leader <persName ref="#pers-BrozJosipTito"
                        >Tito</persName> among them, because they were not completely convinced that
                    the decision at the end of 1952 – that the League of Communists was no longer
                    the leading governmental, but only ideological force – was correct. In view of
                    the number of its members, the "power" of the Communist Party increased, also
                    objectively. When the Party clearly announced its monopoly, the number of its
                    members increased radically. In the end of 1974 the League of Communists of
                    Yugoslavia had 1,192,466 members<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn601" n="598">

                    caused by the fact that Party membership ensured a better chance of social

                    critical of the "regime". The number of people convicted of political offences
                    was small, due to the policy of an iron fist in a velvet glove.<note

                    situation, largely made possible by foreign loans, as well as by the fact that
                    the borders were open for the citizens and their travels abroad. However,
                    excessive foreign borrowing resulted in the economic crisis that Yugoslavia had

                    themselves. The relations between the Yugoslav nations and their republics –

                    relations. Because Yugoslavia was gradually turning from an adversary into an
                    ally, the U.S. and Great Britain, who no longer needed to keep their forces in
                    Trieste, were interested in the normalization of relations between Italy and
                    Yugoslavia; however, this was impossible without a resolution of the question of
                    Trieste. The two powers also tried to resolve the Trieste issue because the
                    Soviet Union was linking it to the question of Austria from May 1950 onward.
                    From late 1949 onward, the U.S. and Great Britain thus pressured Italy and
                    Yugoslavia to come to an agreement which, in their opinion, would be simplest to
                    reach based on the current state of affairs, by assigning Zone A to Italy and
                    Zone B to Yugoslavia, with some minor corrections.<note place="foot"

                    Yugoslavia would get the area around Servola (Škedenj, eastern Trieste) and
                    Aquilinia (Žavlje) and the Muggia Peninsula, while Italy would get Trieste,
                    Koper and Izola with their immediate environs. The two Istrian cities would thus
                    become an Italian enclave with a road and maritime connection to the parent
                    country regulated according to a special regime. At the same time, Italy would

                    stretching from the border between Italy and the FTT valid at the time to
                    Trieste. The swap was justified by the ethnic principle as the demanded area in
                    Zone A was mostly Slovene while Koper and Izola were mostly Italian. The
                    Yugoslav government stressed that the annexation of Servola and Aquilinia was

                        would interpret as the result of extreme concessions given to Italy was the
                        demarcation line, which was actually implemented in 1954 with only minor
                        adjustments.</note> The official Yugoslav explanation claimed that such a
                    proposal was favourable to Italy as the annexed territory would have contained
                    more Yugoslavs (about 48,000) than Yugoslavia Italians (about 29,000). However,
                    looking at the ethnic shares of the minorities, Italy would be home to about
                    50,000 Slovenes more than Yugoslavia would be home to Italians. The Yugoslav
                    negotiators submitted data indicating that the 1910 census of the area annexed
                    to Yugoslavia in 1947 found 114,076 Italians living there, the 1948 census found
                    67,856 and the 1951 census found about 40,000. According to the Yugoslav
                    government, the number of Italians dropped dramatically due to the voluntary
                    emigration of 114,000 Italians (over 30,000 in 1948 alone). The emigration
                    supposedly confirmed that the Italians living there were not an "indigenous
                    ethnic element attached to this place", but, rather, immigrants. According to
                    the same source, about 80,000 Slovenes lived within Italy's borders in

                <p xml:id="p-344">The turning point for the resolution of the Trieste question was
                    the decision made by the two western powers on 8 October 1953 to retreat their
                    troops from Zone A and hand it over to Italy, whereby no date of retreat was
                    set. One of the reasons for the decision were the newly strained relations
                    between Italy and Yugoslavia. As the western powers had not notified the
                    Yugoslav authorities of this measure, the reaction was severe. The Yugoslav
                    government organized mass protests and responded to Italian military
                    reinforcements arriving at the border by sending their own. However, <persName

                <p xml:id="p-345">On 15 October 1953, the situation that had arisen was discussed by
                    the Federal Executive Council of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia
                    (FPRY). Chief reporter <persName ref="#pers-KardeljEdvard">Edvard
                        Kardelj</persName> presented the genesis of the Trieste question and the
                    Yugoslav proposals for its resolution. He noted that the latest measures taken
                    by the U.S. and Great Britain were actually humiliating towards Yugoslavia as
                    the Yugoslav government had always counted on the West taking into account at
                    least a minimal share of Yugoslav demands, i.e. that Italy should not get the
                    whole Zone A, that minorities would be allowed an autonomous statute and that
                    Yugoslav interests in the port of Trieste be recognized. Yugoslavia could thus
                    not acquiesce to the solution that was being forced upon it. The Yugoslav
                    citizens had reacted swiftly and spontaneously as what had happened, according
                    to <persName ref="#pers-KardeljEdvard">Kardelj</persName>, "was not merely the
                    loss of our territory but an insult to our independence and international

                    unrest on 3 November, the anniversary of Italy’s entrance into Trieste in 1918.
                    At the same time, diplomatic talks began, primarily due to Yugoslavia's resolute
                    reaction. The Yugoslav government instructed its negotiators to try and prevent
                    the peace treaty from being implemented, although they were formally not allowed
                    to renounce it as it represented a legal foundation. The negotiators were
                    supposed to make various demands regarding the border that they anticipated to
                    be rejected. However, they were also allowed to negotiate a division along the
                    demarcation line with some adjustments. The treaty was supposed to be formed so
                    that Italy would not formally forgo Zone B and Yugoslavia would not do so for
                    Zone A, while the Western powers would publicly state that they would not
                    support the demands of either side after the agreement on the temporary

                    stressed that the treaty was very clear regarding Yugoslavia's rights in this
                    area. In this regard, he emphasized the Western powers' statement that they
                    would no longer support Italian demands. It was imperative to create such
                    relations between the two countries as to make the border as irrelevant an issue
                    as possible, and <persName ref="#pers-KraigherBoris">Kraigher</persName>
                    believed this could be achieved through the creation of socialist relations in
                    Yugoslavia and Italy. <persName ref="#pers-KraigherBoris">Kraigher</persName>
                    continues: "The Yugoslav policy regarding the western border has long been based
                    on the motto: We'd give our lives – we won't give Trieste! /.../ However, if we
                    wanted to consistently stick to the motto, we should have given our lives back
                    in 1945 when our troops were forced to leave Trieste. That's when this issue was
                    decided." <persName ref="#pers-KraigherBoris">Kraigher</persName> further
                    stressed the importance of the fact that Yugoslavia withdrew its demands
                    regarding Trieste based on an agreement, "that we have forced the Italians to
                    recognize the specificity of our interests in Trieste, to recognize the
                    existence of our national minorities, to recognize our economic interests. /.../
                    I do not believe that this is the only solution for Trieste, however, it is the
                    only one possible at the moment. We will help uplift Koper, but not as
                    competition to Trieste but rather as a centre that would be able to replace
                    Trieste for us. /.../ We will not receive any direct aid from the Allies to
                    build up Zone B, and we haven't requested it either. This is our own
                    undertaking. With regard to our aid to Trieste and our organizations based in

                    Austro-Hungarian period – by the regiments consisting mostly of Slovenians
                    during World War I, and, naturally, by the Slovenian volunteers in the struggle
                    for the borders after World War I. After the establishment of the Kingdom of
                    SHS, in the military ranks of the new Yugoslav state the Serbian command and
                    Serbian language, used for all military matters, prevailed over all other
                    languages spoken by the citizens of the new state. The "uniform" language became
                    an important instrument of centralisation and aspirations to eliminate the
                    national and cultural diversity and form a single nation with a single language.
                    During World War II, the promises of greater equality of the Slovenian language
                    were eagerly accepted by Slovenians, traditionally attached to all Slovenian
                    distinctive characteristics, especially their own language. Slovenians massively
                    joined the ranks of the Slovenian Partisans, also because they listened to
                    commands in their mother tongue during the battles and the Slovenian language
                    was used in all military matters.</p>

                    inquired if the Slovenian language of command, which had asserted itself during
                    the war, would be retained in the Slovenian military units after the war.

                    war, <persName ref="#pers-BrozJosipTito">Tito</persName> and his associates
                    "forgot" that they were supposed to preserve the mono-national military units
                    and the various mother tongues as the languages of command. Instead, the
                    exterritorial principle of conscription was introduced and Serbian (or
                    Serbo-Croatian) was inevitably chosen as the uniform language of command – like
                    in the First Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-354">Federalisation of the state was only partial, and the matters
                    related to the language policy remained especially unclear. Four languages –
                    Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian and Macedonian – were legally equal, but the
                    legislative provisions did not specify the actual implications of language
                    equality. Yugoslav Army was one of the state institutions with almost no regard
                    for language equality. It started to implement the policy of complete linguistic
                    uniformity regardless of the fact that the language of command was
                    incomprehensible for many citizens and reminded them of the inconveniences from
                    the period of the First Yugoslavia.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn649" n="646">

                    all units to the Supreme Headquarters of the Yugoslav Army were followed by the
                    introduction of the uniform conduct of all military affairs in the language of
                    the largest nation. Military units, consisting mostly of Slovenians, were
                    relocated to other parts of Yugoslavia. Consequently – as well as because they
                    lost the right to use the Slovenian language – many Slovenian officers decided
                    to demobilise. The Slovenian political leadership did not react to the changes,
                    dictated from Belgrade, and referred to the promises from the 2<hi

                    Yugoslav Army (later the Yugoslav People's Army – JLA) soon started to crumble
                    in the eyes of Slovenians, proud of the successful organisation of the Slovenian
                    Partisan Army with the Slovenian language of command.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-356">The Yugoslav Constitution, adopted in April 1963, was a clear
                    proof that the state leadership also separated the question of language equality
                    in the Army from other questions of language equality. This Constitution
                    recapitulated the loose provisions of the previous Constitution from 1946,
                    stating that all languages are equal; that minorities have the right to receive
                    education in their own languages; and that the members of other nations are
                    entitled to translation and translators in their communication with state
                    institutions. However, Article 42 of the Constitution provided for an exception
                    to the aforementioned provisions: "By way of exception, Serbo-Croatian language
                    shall be used in the Yugoslav People's Army for command, military education and
                    administrative purposes".<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn650" n="647">

                    language in comparison to Serbo-Croatian was most clearly revealed by the
                    "exclusive use of the Serbo-Croatian language in the administration of the
                    Yugoslav central government authorities and organisations as well as in the

                    which had been the basis of the Slovenian national-political programme of the
                    United Slovenia already in the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century –
                    administration and education – and added language in the military matters. By
                    exposing the inequality of languages in the Yugoslav People's Army, <persName
                        ref="#pers-AvšičJaka">Avšič</persName> suggested that the situation a
                    hundred years later – in the second half of the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                    century – was even worse than in Austria, where, before its dissolution,
                    Slovenian was self-evidently used in the regiments where Slovenian soldiers were
                    in the majority. The publication of <persName ref="#pers-AvšičJaka"
                        >Avšič's</persName> article was definitely a novelty, considering that
                    previously the (more or less) public criticism of the inconsistent use of the
                    Slovenian language had focused on problems in Slovenia and in communication with
                    the Slovenian state bodies. With <persName ref="#pers-AvšičJaka"
                        >Avšič's</persName> contribution, the public debate expanded from the
                    previous areas to the military institutions under the jurisdiction of the
                    Yugoslav federal authorities, operating in the whole territory of Yugoslavia.
                    These opinions encouraged a lively debate already after the lecture in the
                    cultural workers' club. However, after the article was published in the magazine
                    dedicated to the development of the Slovenian language in all areas, the
                    consequent debates and discussions were unprecedented since World War II in
                    Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-359">The leadership of the League of Communists of Slovenia was the
                    first to react. Its Commission for the Relations between Nations and Republics
                    prepared an expert analysis entitled Several Issues of Relations between Nations
                    in the Yugoslav People's Army based on the data collected until 1967. The
                    analysis stated that the below-average share of Slovenians among officers was
                    problematic. Approximately two thirds of Slovenian officers had been promoted to
                    their rank already during the war and would fulfil retirement conditions in the
                    following years. In order to replace them and match the share of Slovenian
                    officers with the share of Slovenian citizens in Yugoslavia, approximately 1500
                    officers had to be trained in the next few years. Nevertheless, since 1961 only
                    106 candidates from Slovenia had been admitted to military schools, and after
                    1964 less than ten Slovenians per year enrolled in these schools. In order to
                    balance their numbers with the national structure in Yugoslavia, at least 200
                    Slovenians per year should enrol in military schools. Consequently the share of
                    Slovenians (and members of other smaller nations) among officers decreased,
                    while the share of the largest nation swiftly increased: "Without any intention
                    to discuss the actions, undertaken or planned by the Army to draw applicants to
                    military schools, it is a fact that these actions have not been successful so
                    far, at least not in Slovenia. It is a well-known fact that among the officers
                    from the war 25 % are Serbian, while their share amounts to as much as 65 % of
                    the total number of the post-war officers in the Yugoslav People's Army." In
                    their search for potential causes, the authors of the expert analysis drew the
                    attention to different problems. In line with the preceding official doctrine
                    they unexpectedly wrote: "The language issue, at least as far as the language of
                    command in the Army is concerned, is not problematic." In continuation they
                    mentioned that, on the contrary, "language is an important factor in the demand
                    to constantly move from one language area to another, which implies forcible
                    adaptation to new circumstances",<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn652" n="649">

                    wives to find a job, children had problems with schooling in other language

                    the share of soldiers who would serve their duty in their native territory.
                    Slovenian officers would supposedly be allowed to serve in the units in
                    Slovenia, at least in the first few years. Furthermore, after finishing military
                    school, cadets would return as interns to the military units in the territory of
                    their respective republics, while the exterritorial principle of conscription
                    would only be considered with regard to the needs for special technical

                    Yugoslavia as the continuation of Serbian political achievements in the Kingdom

                    position that language equality had always been a part of Slovenian political
                    demands; that Slovenian language was especially threatened during the occupation
                    in World War II; and that the demands for the equality of mother tongue were the
                    very motive for joining the Partisan ranks for many Slovenians who were
                    favourably inclined towards a federal transformation of the state. "One of the
                    proofs of Slovenian statehood (sovereignty) is the establishment of Slovenian
                    command in the Partisan and regular units of the Slovenian Liberation Army. At
                    that time, Slovenian language was used exclusively in all Slovenian military

                        >Avšič</persName> and added that this was also the only possible way. In his
                    opinion, one of the reasons for the rapid downfall of the First Yugoslavia's
                    Army was that it was "detested, because officers and junior officers despised
                    people of non-Serbian nations and languages",<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn657"

                    large part of its citizens, which accounted for the lack of patriotism and
                    combat preparedness. <persName ref="#pers-AvšičJaka">Avšič's</persName> approach
                    was convincing and well-argued since it was based on primary sources to describe
                    the development of the national and language policy in the Communist Party
                    before the war and in the Partisan units. The mother tongue, i.e. Slovenian, was
                    soon being used consistently in these units in the Slovenian territory, although
                    men with experience from the Yugoslav or even the old Austrian Army and the
                    Spanish Civil War were among the officers. "Slovenian fighters were proud of
                    their language, which prevailed entirely in the National Liberation Struggle.

                    state of affairs would be preserved also after the war. He emphasised that there
                    had not been any operative issues due to the Slovenian language of command
                    because the Slovenian units had easily cooperated with the units from other

                    and alphabets of Yugoslav nations and nationalities should be implemented in the
                    organisation and functioning of the national defence and in the Yugoslav
                    People's Army". The position with regard to the constitutional provision on the
                    uniform language of command was that "the possibilities for a more extensive
                    implementation of the principles of the equality of languages and alphabets of
                    Yugoslav nations and nationalities in a certain part of the Yugoslav People's
                    Army should be examined" and "specific regulations should be adopted
                        accordingly".<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn659" n="656">

                    politically controversial or chauvinist acts. While the discussions about the
                    language issues in certain other fields had already been on the agenda earlier,
                    the publication of the Federal Assembly's resolution opened the door also to the

                    resorting to the misleading and embellished political rhetoric. Subsequently he
                    provided a detailed and substantiated explanation of the eighteen introductory
                    theses. His attitude towards the language of command was completely clear: "The
                    claim that modern warfare demands one language of command cannot withstand
                    critical analysis. The equality of languages of the Yugoslav nations would
                    enhance the capability and fighting efficiency of the Army. The speed of
                    executing the actions is not affected by using the languages of the
                        nations."<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn663" n="660">
                        <bibl>Ibid., p. 1</bibl>.</note> Instead of obliging the majority to learn a
                    foreign language, the same could be expected of the commanding minority: "Only
                    officers should learn the required language and the team could be given commands
                    in their mother tongue." Contrary to the official name – Serbo-Croatian or
                    Croatian-Serbian language – he occasionally used the expression Serbian
                    language, indirectly pointing to the privileged position of one nation with
                    regard to military matters: "By using one language – Serbian – only formal,
                    superficial unity is achieved. The Yugoslav People's Army needs a substantive
                    unity, which can only benefit from using the mother tongue." Historical
                    experiences with imposing the use of one language were too painful, mentioned
                        <persName ref="#pers-AvšičJaka">Avšič</persName>, and harshly criticised the
                    policy of perpetuating the old patterns: "The motives of certain people who
                    argue for maintaining one language are centralist and unitarian in their nature
                    and point to a lag in the society's development."<note place="foot"

                    military units could also be assigned in the exterritorial manner, and
                    especially that officers should learn the language of their soldiers. In
                        <persName ref="#pers-AvšičJaka">Avšič's</persName> opinion, the opposition
                    against introducing language equality also stemmed from the fact that "officers
                    currently speak only one language – Serbo-Croatian". He concluded the
                    contribution by severely criticising officers: "Is seems that they are not able
                    to fathom how smooth the transition to language equality would be, if only the
                    system of manning the units would be changed. What seems to prevail is some kind
                    of incomprehensible mentality about the inequality of nations and the
                    entitlement of the Serbian language and people to privileges."<note place="foot"

                    the nationally-uniform military units where the language of command would be
                    their mother tongue. The potential lack of officers, proficient in military
                    expressions in the mother tongue, would be resolved with additional measures,
                    while military schools would introduce lessons in the languages of different
                    Yugoslav nations in order to also attract more nationally-diverse

                    two hundred to learn a foreign language. He added another very clear demand: to

                    language in the Army: "The part of Article 42 of the Federal Constitution,

                    suspecting that the search for solutions had taken a wrong turn. For example, in
                    March 1970 the Delo newspaper refused to publish his response to the article
                    where the official information about the radical shortage of Slovenians among

                    again he underlined the extreme importance of the mother tongue when it came to
                    choosing the military profession: "Enough high-quality personnel existed for the
                    Slovenian units until the very end of the war as well as in 1945 in the central
                    institutions. Then the number of Slovenians started decreasing. When the
                    Slovenian units were abolished, reassigned to every location, and the Army
                    started using the Serbo-Croatian language, Slovenians lost their enthusiasm to

                    insinuating that the demands for a greater equality of languages in the Army
                    only implied the formation of a nationally homogenous Slovenian army. Such an
                    opinion was also noticeable among Slovenian officers, who may have merely been
                    adhering to the official doctrine of the military leadership or had been a part
                    of the military way of thinking for so long that they were not even able to
                    register the atmosphere of their native, Slovenian environment. For the first
                    time the discussions mentioned the fates of the Slovenian officers who had
                    completely lost every contact with their native environment and mother tongue
                    due to the years of working in the Yugoslav People's Army. When he familiarised

                <p xml:id="p-370">At the end of the 1960s and in the beginning of the 1970s the
                    Slovenian "liberal"-communist politics allowed for the publication of very
                    controversial responses to the social reality. Thus <persName

                    could publish severe criticism on account of language inequality, which had been
                    quite impossible only a decade ago. Slovenian politics familiarised itself with
                    these positions, information and argumentation, and used it to formulate its own
                    standpoints. However, it did not possess <persName ref="#pers-AvšičJaka"
                        >Avšič's</persName> clarity and the political severity of his words. Above
                    all, it often had to defend itself from Belgrade due to the reproaches of
                    Slovenian nationalism.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-371">After the adoption of the resolution on the equality of languages,
                    the State Secretariat for People's Defence came up with a plan of how to fulfil
                    its demands with regard to the use of language in the Army. In December 1969
                    State Secretary Colonel General <persName ref="#pers-LjubičićNikola">Nikola
                        Ljubičić</persName> ordered that the competent state and military

                    which they obviously did not have at their disposal yet, and study the issue of
                    languages from the viewpoint of peacetime and wartime circumstances before
                    finally sending their findings to the competent authorities at the State

                    information on the use of languages and alphabets in all military matters at its
                    disposal in 1970. As far as the education of officer staff was concerned,
                    attention should be paid to the "need and possibilities of learning the
                    Slovenian and Macedonian languages in the military schools" as well as to the
                    organisation of language courses for officers, where the basics of other
                    languages would be taught. Additionally, it should also be stated what realistic
                    obstacles may prevent the achievement of the complete equality of languages and
                        alphabets.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn676" n="673">

                    The majority of the analysis regarding the ways of ensuring the equality of
                    languages in the military would supposedly be complete in 1970, and other
                    proposals for changes should also be outlined. The order refrained from
                    revealing any concrete information, but as far as the demands for the increased
                    equality of the Slovenian and Macedonian languages were concerned it was usually
                    stated that the "needs and possibilities" in that regard should be explored.
                    This formulation was occasionally omitted, and thus equality was apparently
                    definitely possible. For example, the demands also noted the assurance of
                    equality during the military court proceedings.<note place="foot"

                <p xml:id="p-372">The military circles' reluctance to implement changes was obvious
                    from the manner of their statements: that they would implement changes "where
                    possible", under certain conditions, etc. The Ministry of Defence also wrote
                    that the share of officers serving in their native environment would be
                    increased, and that smaller mono-national units would be established ("where
                    possible", of course). Senior officers would not be obliged to learn the
                    languages of their surroundings. However, they would be encouraged to do it with
                    a system of rewards, and in so far as possible the written letters of certain
                    bodies would be responded to in the language of the original letter. However,
                    most of the training, command and coordination activities in the Yugoslav
                    People's Army were listed as tasks where the use of a single language would not
                    be possible to avoid. "The national languages, aside from the uniform language"
                    could only be used in the units dominated by soldiers of a single nationality.
                    Furthermore, this principle was also applied in the territorial defence, the
                    elaboration of the Ministry of Defence stated. Already the use of the term
                    "uniform language", which Yugoslavia had never known, indirectly indicated that
                    the military leadership did not possess much understanding for the demands for a
                    greater equality of languages in the Army. The argument used by the State
                    Secretariat for People's Defence to support the need for the use of
                    Serbo-Croatian language was misleading as well. The competent authorities stated
                    the following fact as the reason for this: that "90 % of all senior officers
                    currently employed in the Yugoslav People's Army belong to the nations speaking
                        Serbo-Croatian".<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn678" n="675">

                    consequence were obviously reversed here, because the high percentage of Serbian
                    (and Croatian) speaking officers was the consequence of using only one language
                    in the Army, not the reason for the use of this language.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-373">It was characteristic of such statements, coming from the military
                    circles, that during the preparation of plans of how to meet the demands for a
                    greater equality of languages in the Army references were only made to the
                    demands of the Federal Assembly resolution. The absence of any arguments
                    associating the greater equality with an improved atmosphere in the Army and its
                    enhanced battle efficiency was obvious. At least a hint of the good will of the
                    military leadership was displayed in the plan signed in January 1970 by Colonel
                    General <persName ref="#pers-DolničarIvan">Ivan Dolničar</persName>, the
                    Slovenian Assistant State Secretary of People's Defence at the time. The plan
                    mostly listed what should be analysed, how soon it should be studied, and in
                    what cases a greater equality of languages in the operations of the Yugoslav
                    People's Army could be implemented. However, <persName ref="#pers-DolničarIvan"

                    traditionalism, as well as appeals to the Constitution which nevertheless
                    prescribed the extraordinary position of the Serbo-Croatian language in the
                    Army, should be expected.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn679" n="676">

                    secret by the military and state leadership. The willingness of the military
                    leadership to implement any significant changes dwindled with every passing
                    month, and after the showdown with the Party "liberals", more favourably
                    inclined towards decisive steps forward in Yugoslavia, the military leadership
                    simply started disregarding any initiatives. When in the beginning of 1971 the
                    military magazines published that an exception with regard to the language of

                    the concern that things might be heading in the wrong direction was becoming
                    increasingly well-founded. As the republican leaderships from the ranks of
                    "Party liberals" were replaced one after the other by the communists from the
                    older, more dogmatic generation, the willingness to embrace changes disappeared.
                    The wheels of Yugoslav politics turned in the opposite direction, back to the
                    time when open debates and controversial ideas were pushed into the realm of
                    private affairs. To prevent this from happening after all, <persName

                    fighters, who accepted this as a natural right that they were entitled to. "This

                    this was mostly because of the Territorial Defence, while much less was achieved

                    prepared by the Society for Slavic Studies of Slovenia and the Socialist

                        It is a fact, however, that both forms of repression did exist in a kind of

                    1954), exclusively for political reasons. Until the formal abolishment of the

                    death sentence in Yugoslavia was executed in Titograd), the death sentence was
                    pronounced 12 more times – of course only for serious criminal offences – and
                    the last person was executed in 1959. The public opinion turned against capital
                    punishment as early as 1963, when such sentence was the subject of a series of

                <p xml:id="p-382">As the state apparatus is repressive by its very nature, the
                    category of repressive bodies operating in Slovenia during the second
                    Yugoslavian state needs to be delineated within a broader conception. Since some
                    of the constituent parts of state administration have a much more repressive
                    character, this paper focuses on them. The topic is thus broken down into three
                    segments, which were analysed in detail, namely the judiciary, intelligence and
                    security services and police bodies. In light of the definition given above and
                    considering today's understanding of the period in question, however, the
                    category could be expanded to include other services as well. And if I had
                    mentioned that my wish is to understand the context inhabited by ordinary
                    citizens, it should also be pointed out that I was, unfortunately, unable to pay
                    due attention to the one repressive body of the state that probably caused the
                    most undue stress among the citizens of socialist Slovenia. The body in question
                    was not controlled by the government of the republic but was rather under
                    federal control, and reactions to it were similar to today's reactions to any
                    reference made to the Tax Administration. I'm referring to the Customs
                    Administration, which was encountered by most citizens at least a few times per
                    year as they were travelling abroad with their meagre handfuls of foreign
                    currency they managed to save.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-383">In light of the structure and constitutional changes effected in
                    the second Yugoslavia, the operation of these bodies must always be considered
                    with respect to their connections with those the federal level. Although the
                    decentralization process that was being carried out for most of the time during
                    the second Yugoslavia resulted in a gradually increasing independence of all
                    these bodies, federal legislation in these areas had a profound impact on the
                    newly drafted legislations at the level of individual republics, inhibiting the
                    development of notable particularities. Nevertheless, at the time of severe
                    constitutional changes and increasingly liberal tendencies emerging in the
                    governments of respective republics, the Yugoslav leadership always clearly
                    maintained that certain sectors had to remain under federal control.<note

                        things I believe should be resolved by the same Act, by the Constitution.
                        First of all, the relations between the federation and the republics, i.e.

                        determine the responsibilities of the federation. In this regard, we have to
                        be perfectly clear on the concepts we are using and determine these with the
                        Constitution, starting from the issues indicated by comrade <persName

                        accordance with agreements we had actually already come to at some of our
                        previous sessions. First of all, it has to be clear what the federation's
                        responsibilities are regarding national defence, and particularly how these
                        responsibilities are to be fulfilled. I am saying this as it is clear that,
                        when we speak of these matters, we are fixing them for the time when comrade
                            <persName ref="#pers-BrozJosipTito">Tito</persName> will no longer be
                        the President of the Republic or our supreme commander. With regard to some
                        things that seem perfectly clear today as they were shaped by our
                        revolutionary history, we will have to agree on the relations that would be

                    The process of decentralization culminated in the 1974 constitution that gave
                    the republics as well as autonomous provinces a large degree of independence
                    along with the hope that the Yugoslav national question would finally be taken
                    off the agenda once and for all. Accordingly, the role of the governments of
                    individual republics became more important as these bodies played a decisive
                    role in various areas, while others remained the responsibility of the federal
                    government. Nevertheless, centralist tendencies remained present in the
                    background, and although they suffered a serious blow after 1966, they recovered
                    in the mid-1980s, particularly in Serbia, which significantly contributed to the
                    popularity of the Slovenian policy which defended what had been, in terms of
                    decentralization, obtained in the past and bolstered it even further, and which
                    ultimately, in combination with other circumstances, resulted in Slovenia
                    declaring its independence. By transferring a relatively major part of the
                    jurisdiction over various repressive bodies to the governments of individual
                    republics, these achieved a higher level of sovereignty which was, towards the
                    end of the period in question, particularly pronounced in Slovenia due to the
                    its specific political and economic development as well as its ethnic
                    homogeneity. The creation of the Territorial Defence thus allowed the Slovenian
                    Armed Forces to be established relatively quickly, despite various complications
                    due to the attempts by federal and military authorities to interfere just prior
                    to the break up of Yugoslavia, while independent police and intelligence
                    apparatuses allowed the country to control its borders and territory. The broad
                    jurisdiction of the republic in this area thus allowed for a result that would
                    probably have been impossible in a federation with a more centralist structure
                    as the whole repressive apparatus, except for most of the armed forces, was
                    controlled by the republic.</p>

                        features that were gradually phased out after 1956, as the Militia turned to
                        Western models and formed connections with people and local environments.
                        Although an act passed in 1956 put the Militia under a unified internal
                        affairs administration, it also placed significant emphasis on the municipal
                        bodies, so that the institutions of local self-government played an
                        important part in the provision of public security in its territories. Prior
                        to 1956, the public order was, in addition to the general People's Militia,
                        also kept by specialized firemen's, forest, traffic and ancillary

                        introduced by the Internal Affairs Service Act from 1964, which stipulated
                        that the operation of public security services was to be public, as it
                        remains today. After 1967, almost entire control over the internal affairs
                        authorities passed to individual republics, while, formally and legally, the
                        transfer was made final by the republics' internal affairs act of 1973.
                        However, the most important advance in the sovereignty of individual
                        republics was the transfer of jurisdiction from the border police working at
                        all types of border crossings, even the international ones, to individual
                        republics. This affected about a third of all militiamen, who were
                        subsequently trained at the Tacen academy. The national border surveillance
                        remained under the jurisdiction of federal authorities since it was the
                        responsibility of the military, as was also the case with the customs
                        service. Among other things, the act of 1967 formally greatly limited the
                        use of physical violence and particularly of firearms in police work,
                        allowing militiamen the use of firearms against fleeing suspects only if the
                        minimum sentence for the criminal offence a suspect had allegedly committed
                        was longer than 15 years. In spite of the decreasingly repressive character
                        of internal affairs authorities, the data from crime statistics allow us to
                        conclude that the ominous headlines that accompanied it (<hi rend="italic"

                        etc.) did not reflect the facts. From 1958 to 1979, the number of recorded
                        criminal offences thus fluctuated between approx. 18,000 and 28,000, and the
                        drastic changes were usually the result of amendments to criminal laws and
                        general shifts in the society. One such shift occurred in the openness of
                        state borders for travellers or individuals working abroad. Starting with
                        the amending act of 1959, which limited the prosecution of criminal offences

                        crossing, changed to violent crossings only), commentators note a drastic
                        decrease in the number of such offences, from thousands recorded in the
                        1950s to a couple of hundreds, and the decrease is further supported by,
                        e.g., the elimination of criminal complaints due to injuries sustained in
                        fistfights, which were subsequently generally resolved in civil proceedings.
                        Furthermore, these changes resulted in a significant decrease in the use of
                        detention on remand, which was gradually excluded from the conventional
                        investigation procedure. Additionally, in the mid-1950s, slightly more than
                        half of all individuals detained infringed the Article 303. The somewhat
                        incomplete statistics (1951 and 1952 are missing) tell us that 77,778
                        individuals were apprehended at the Slovenian state border between 1947 and
                            1962.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn705" n="702">

                        offences against property, which were, at the same time, among the least
                        frequently resolved cases. From 25 % to 30 % of all criminal cases, mostly
                        thefts, remained unsolved, and the number of sex crimes was on a sharp

                        to the ubiquity of the state repressive apparatus, it is more probable that

                        fundamental aspect of state repressive bodies and a significant element of
                        the state's security system. In its essence, the aim of intelligence and
                        security services was to collect, process and analyse data pertinent to
                        state security and the country's economic and political relations with other
                        countries. However, from the fundamental objectives delineated above, i.e.

                        typical of socialist or rather single-party/totalitarian countries and used
                        to control internal opposition. The Yugoslav security-intelligence system
                        originated from the Soviet system of intelligence services, which were
                        intertwined with all areas of life<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn710" n="707"

                        repressive apparatus. In socialist countries, it was common for the security
                        and intelligence services to have their own security forces, either a
                        military or a police one. Initially, this was the case in Yugoslavia too;
                        however, the reach of security and intelligence services, which radically
                        increased after World War II, was later subject to significant limitations.
                        Despite the obvious extensiveness of the security-intelligence network, it
                        can be said that the operation of security and intelligence services
                        progressed in accordance with the somewhat more liberal approach to the
                        social system typical of Yugoslavia, when compared to other countries of
                        what was, at the time, the Eastern Bloc. In democratically organized social
                        systems, the operation of security and intelligence services is controlled
                        by the government and the parliament; however, this is simply not possible
                        in single-party political systems, and so in the Yugoslav case, the state
                        security services were part of this system and thus under the jurisdiction
                        of the Communist Party, i.e. the political leaders of the country. As put

                        during the time of the second Yugoslavia, an assessment of the

                        based on events that occurred during World War II. As early as 1941, the
                        Slovenian resistance movement established the Security-Intelligence Service
                        of the Liberation Front (VOS OF), which then underwent a slight
                        reorganization based on the 1942 orders from the Supreme Command of the
                        National Liberation Army and the Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (NOV and
                        POJ) and was thus coordinated within the policies of the pan-Yugoslav
                        resistance movement. A fully unified and centrally controlled security and

                        in some cases, the pursuit aimed against members of the armed groups that
                        opposed the regime lasted until the early 1950s, while some state borders
                        were questionable even after that – the services received a new blow, i.e.
                        the Cominform Resolution of June 1948. The Yugoslav internal and foreign
                        policies, which had exhibited some notably Eastern tendencies, was now
                        facing a conflict with former friends and mentors, resulting in an even
                        greater need for decisive action on the part of the security and
                        intelligence service, who could no longer only focus on operations against
                        Western adversaries, hostile and extremist emigrant organizations and
                        remnants of the internal bourgeois opposition, but was forced to find
                        enemies even amongst its own circles. After the years immediately following
                        the Cominform Resolution, during which the Yugoslav government tried to be
                        holier than the Pope by rapidly adopting the Soviet patterns, intense
                        contacts with the previously hated West that now allowed the regime to
                        survive resulted in a slight liberalization and in attempts to find a unique
                        way into socialism. Nevertheless, this was the period during which UDV was
                        rapidly becoming increasingly powerful and important, and its virtually

                            detection to detention and administrative sentencing, was carried out by

                        usually comes up with the worst examples of abuse, which characterized the
                        initial years of the second Yugoslav state and had a significant impact on
                        the lives of all people in Yugoslavia. According to <persName

                        fundamental characteristic of any communist totalitarian system that carries
                        out repressive activities against its citizens. Although he said that
                        Yugoslavia did not differ much from other "real socialist" countries in this
                        respect, <persName ref="#pers-MikolaMilko">Mikola</persName> also noted that
                        the level of repression varied from one period to another. The period when
                        state repression was at its worst can thus be placed between the end of
                        World War II and 1952, a time mainly characterized by mass extrajudicial
                        killings, forced forfeitures of property, show trials, forced labour
                        sentences and deportations of people from their places of residence.<note

                        onwards, SDV was fully federalized, and although there a federal SDV still
                        operated in Belgrade, its jurisdiction was further reduced and transferred
                        to state and regional services; the intelligence service of the Foreign
                        Affairs Secretariat became more independent as well. Nevertheless, the
                        mentality of SDV did not change extensively as the domination of traditional
                        thought patterns and priority assessments were present all the way up to the
                        break-up of Yugoslavia. The main concern of the service were hostile
                        emigrant groups, though the Cominform-related issues received a lot of
                        attention too. This trend was further enhanced by events in the late 1970s
                        and 1980s as various extremist formations from outside Yugoslavia attempted
                        to carry out terrorist attacks, even in the Yugoslav territory – in 1972,
                        SDV prevented an incursion of an armed formation composed of Croatian
                        emigrants. Soviet operations in Czechoslovakia were another source of
                        concern, as was the wave of student protests that started in the same year
                        and, towards the end of the year, mutated into general protests against the
                        existing constitutional arrangement in Kosovo, while the early 1970s were
                        marked by an ousting of liberal politicians from the national governments in
                        Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn734" n="731">

                        repression, particularly so for the socialist countries where the communist
                        ideology dictated that the actual power be in the hands of the Party as the
                        vanguard and representative of the working people. However, such tendencies
                        could be quite problematic and were extremely rare in the Slovenian part of
                        the judiciary,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn735" n="732">Among 144 permanent

                        important feature of the Party, and such ideas applied to the government as
                        well. Even formally, the judiciary system was initially not an independent
                        third branch of the government, being instead susceptible to direct
                        interventions by executive authorities, even the local ones, and to
                        proceedings often conducted by UDV. That the role of the judiciary branch,
                        together with the rest of the repressive apparatus, was much more repressive
                        than today, was particularly evident from the end of World War II to 1953,
                        when the adoption of constitutional legislation and societal shifts resulted
                        in the position of the judiciary branch becoming at least formally similar
                        to the position it holds today. The courts used to be controlled by local
                        authorities, which resulted in frequent misuse assisted by the broadness of
                        legislation, particularly regarding political offences. After 1953, the
                        situation improved considerably, and the situation in Slovenia was
                        characterized by a significant decrease in the number of political trials,
                        dropping from approximately 1000 between 1947 and 1950 to 207 in 1952, 91 in
                        1953 and less than 50 in the following years.<note place="foot"

                        with the establishment of national constitutional courts pursuant to the
                        Federal Constitution of 1963. Until then, Yugoslavia did not have a
                        constitutional court, and the protection of legality was the province of
                        socio-political communities. This meant that the highest segment of the
                        judicial system, the constitutional judiciary, came under national
                        jurisdiction, which was extremely important for the sovereignty of the
                        republics as the national constitutions reflected the federal constitution,
                        thus allowing the Slovenian constitutional court to decide in all matters
                        related to national legislation and even in some matters connected to
                        federal laws. Another important branch of the judiciary system eventually
                        came under national jurisdiction, though this happened quite late. It was
                        only the constitutional amendments of 1974 that allowed individual republics
                        to take over the public prosecution service (law from 1977, in effect from
                        1979). Although the public prosecution had been organized on the territorial
                        bases and received guidelines from national governments, it remained a body
                        of the federal government, which operated in accordance with the
                        instructions of the federal and national assemblies.<note place="foot"

                        politically problematic until 1988, when the issue inflamed the Slovenian
                        public opinion at the time of the JBTZ trial. The fact that both the public
                        prosecution service and the rest of the judiciary system operated in
