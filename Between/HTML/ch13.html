After the establishment of the Kingdom of SHS, in the military ranks of the new Yugoslav state the Serbian command and Serbian language, used for all military matters, prevailed over all other languages spoken by the citizens of the new state. The "uniform" language became an important instrument of centralisation and aspirations to eliminate the national and cultural diversity and form a single nation with a single language. During World War II, the promises of greater equality of the Slovenian language were eagerly accepted by Slovenians, traditionally attached to all Slovenian distinctive characteristics, especially their own language. Slovenians massively joined the ranks of the Slovenian Partisans, also because they listened to commands in their mother tongue during the battles and the Slovenian language was used in all military matters.</p><p id="p-352"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>The leaders of the Slovenian resistance movement relied on the promises, given during the transformation into a federal state, that Slovenian military units with Slovenian language of command would also be preserved after the war.

Instead, the exterritorial principle of conscription was introduced and Serbian (or Serbo-Croatian) was inevitably chosen as the uniform language of command – like in the First Yugoslavia.</p><p id="p-354"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>Federalisation of the state was only partial, and the matters related to the language policy remained especially unclear. Four languages – Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian and Macedonian – were legally equal, but the legislative provisions did not specify the actual implications of language equality. Yugoslav Army was one of the state institutions with almost no regard for language equality. It started to implement the policy of complete linguistic uniformity regardless of the fact that the language of command was incomprehensible for many citizens and reminded them of the inconveniences from the period of the First Yugoslavia.<span id="ftn649_return"><a class="notelink" title="For more information see: Aleš Gabrič: Uveljavljanje slovenščine kot uradnega jezika po drugi svetovni vojni [Assertion of the Slovenian Language as t…" href="#ftn649"><sup>646</sup></a></span></p><p id="p-355"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>The abolishment of the republican commands and subordination of all units to the Supreme Headquarters of the Yugoslav Army were followed by the introduction of the uniform conduct of all military affairs in the language of the largest nation. Military units, consisting mostly of Slovenians, were relocated to other parts of Yugoslavia. Consequently – as well as because they lost the right to use the Slovenian language – many Slovenian officers decided to demobilise. The Slovenian political leadership did not react to the changes, dictated from Belgrade, and referred to the promises from the 2<sup itemprop="hi">nd</sup> session of the AVNOJ. The reputation of the Yugoslav Army (later the Yugoslav People's Army – JLA) soon started to crumble in the eyes of Slovenians, proud of the successful organisation of the Slovenian Partisan Army with the Slovenian language of command.</p><p id="p-356"><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>The Yugoslav Constitution, adopted in April 1963, was a clear proof that the state leadership also separated the question of language equality in the Army from other questions of language equality. This Constitution recapitulated the loose provisions of the previous Constitution from 1946, stating that all languages are equal; that minorities have the right to receive education in their own languages; and that the members of other nations are entitled to translation and translators in their communication with state institutions. However, Article 42 of the Constitution provided for an exception to the aforementioned provisions: "By way of exception, Serbo-Croatian language shall be used in the Yugoslav People's Army for command, military education and administrative purposes".<span id="ftn650_return"><a class="notelink" title="Uradni list SFRJ, No. 14, 10 April 1963, p. 269." href="#ftn650"><sup>647</sup></a></span></p><p id="p-357"><span class="numberParagraph">7</span>The disregard for the Slovenian language in the Army was first mentioned in public by the retired Lieutenant Colonel General <a id="person-1323"></a><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">Jaka Avšič</span></span><sup><a class="person" href="persons.html#pers-Av%C5%A1i%C4%8DJaka" title="List of persons: No. 1323">[pers.]</a></sup> during his lecture in the cultural workers' club in Ljubljana, on 13 December 1966.

With <a id="person-1330"></a><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">Avšič's</span></span><sup><a class="person" href="persons.html#pers-Av%C5%A1i%C4%8DJaka" title="List of persons: No. 1330">[pers.]</a></sup> contribution, the public debate expanded from the previous areas to the military institutions under the jurisdiction of the Yugoslav federal authorities, operating in the whole territory of Yugoslavia. These opinions encouraged a lively debate already after the lecture in the cultural workers' club. However, after the article was published in the magazine dedicated to the development of the Slovenian language in all areas, the consequent debates and discussions were unprecedented since World War II in Yugoslavia.</p><p id="p-359"><span class="numberParagraph">9</span>The leadership of the League of Communists of Slovenia was the first to react. Its Commission for the Relations between Nations and Republics prepared an expert analysis entitled Several Issues of Relations between Nations in the Yugoslav People's Army based on the data collected until 1967. The analysis stated that the below-average share of Slovenians among officers was problematic. Approximately two thirds of Slovenian officers had been promoted to their rank already during the war and would fulfil retirement conditions in the following years. In order to replace them and match the share of Slovenian officers with the share of Slovenian citizens in Yugoslavia, approximately 1500 officers had to be trained in the next few years. Nevertheless, since 1961 only 106 candidates from Slovenia had been admitted to military schools, and after 1964 less than ten Slovenians per year enrolled in these schools. In order to balance their numbers with the national structure in Yugoslavia, at least 200 Slovenians per year should enrol in military schools. Consequently the share of Slovenians (and members of other smaller nations) among officers decreased, while the share of the largest nation swiftly increased: "Without any intention to discuss the actions, undertaken or planned by the Army to draw applicants to military schools, it is a fact that these actions have not been successful so far, at least not in Slovenia. It is a well-known fact that among the officers from the war 25 % are Serbian, while their share amounts to as much as 65 % of the total number of the post-war officers in the Yugoslav People's Army." In their search for potential causes, the authors of the expert analysis drew the attention to different problems. In line with the preceding official doctrine they unexpectedly wrote: "The language issue, at least as far as the language of command in the Army is concerned, is not problematic." In continuation they mentioned that, on the contrary, "language is an important factor in the demand to constantly move from one language area to another, which implies forcible adaptation to new circumstances",<span id="ftn652_return"><a class="notelink" title="SI AS 1589, IV, box 188, 434, Nekatera vprašanje mednacionalnih odnosov v JLA, p. 3." href="#ftn652"><sup>649</sup></a></span> it was difficult or impossible for wives to find a job, children had problems with schooling in other language environments, etc. The authors of the analysis saw the solution in augmenting the share of soldiers who would serve their duty in their native territory. Slovenian officers would supposedly be allowed to serve in the units in Slovenia, at least in the first few years. Furthermore, after finishing military school, cadets would return as interns to the military units in the territory of their respective republics, while the exterritorial principle of conscription would only be considered with regard to the needs for special technical expertise.<span id="ftn653_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid., pp. 4–6." href="#ftn653"><sup>650</sup></a></span></p><p id="p-360"><span class="numberParagraph">10</span>The Commission for the Relations between Nations and Republics of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Slovenia was reserved in its position, even though <a id="person-1331"></a><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">Jaka Avšič</span></span><sup><a class="person" href="persons.html#pers-Av%C5%A1i%C4%8DJaka" title="List of persons: No. 1331">[pers.]</a></sup> had presented very concrete proposals.

"One of the proofs of Slovenian statehood (sovereignty) is the establishment of Slovenian command in the Partisan and regular units of the Slovenian Liberation Army.

The resolution was based on the position that constitutional principles already ensured the absolute equality of languages and alphabets, and that only a more detailed specification of particular sections and introduction of consistent implementation of constitutional provisions were needed. The section on the language issues in the Army was written in a rather general context of the demands that "the principles of the equality of languages and alphabets of Yugoslav nations and nationalities should be implemented in the organisation and functioning of the national defence and in the Yugoslav People's Army". The position with regard to the constitutional provision on the uniform language of command was that "the possibilities for a more extensive implementation of the principles of the equality of languages and alphabets of Yugoslav nations and nationalities in a certain part of the Yugoslav People's Army should be examined" and "specific regulations should be adopted accordingly".<span id="ftn659_return"><a class="notelink" title="Uradni list SFRJ, No. 20, 8 May 1969, pp. 610–612." href="#ftn659"><sup>656</sup></a></span> The adoption of the resolution brought a clear message to the citizens: that the equality of languages in Yugoslavia had not yet been accomplished, and that debates about this issue could not be deemed as politically controversial or chauvinist acts.

The Yugoslav People's Army needs a substantive unity, which can only benefit from using the mother tongue."

He concluded the contribution by severely criticising officers: "Is seems that they are not able to fathom how smooth the transition to language equality would be, if only the system of manning the units would be changed.

In these comments he already explicitly referred to the federal resolution on the use of languages. He argued for the "territorial" allocation of conscripts in the vicinity of their home, in the nationally-uniform military units where the language of command would be their mother tongue.

Once again he argued for the formation of nationally homogenous units where the language of command would be the mother tongue, and insisted that, in case of mixed units, it would be far more sensible to require of one person instead of two hundred to learn a foreign language. He added another very clear demand: to change the Constitution in the article providing for the advantageous use of one language in the Army: "The part of Article 42 of the Federal Constitution, referring to the exceptional position of the Army, should be deleted." <span id="ftn669_return"><a class="notelink" title="Jaka Avšič: Nekatera odprta vprašanja vseljudske obrambe [Certain Open Questions about the General People's Defence].

For example, the demands also noted the assurance of equality during the military court proceedings.<span id="ftn677_return"><a class="notelink" title="SI AS 1589, IV, box 189, 435; ibid., p. 4." href="#ftn677"><sup>674</sup></a></span></p><p id="p-372"><span class="numberParagraph">22</span>The military circles' reluctance to implement changes was obvious from the manner of their statements: that they would implement changes "where possible", under certain conditions, etc. The Ministry of Defence also wrote that the share of officers serving in their native environment would be increased, and that smaller mono-national units would be established ("where possible", of course). Senior officers would not be obliged to learn the languages of their surroundings. However, they would be encouraged to do it with a system of rewards, and in so far as possible the written letters of certain bodies would be responded to in the language of the original letter. However, most of the training, command and coordination activities in the Yugoslav People's Army were listed as tasks where the use of a single language would not be possible to avoid. "The national languages, aside from the uniform language" could only be used in the units dominated by soldiers of a single nationality. Furthermore, this principle was also applied in the territorial defence, the elaboration of the Ministry of Defence stated. Already the use of the term "uniform language", which Yugoslavia had never known, indirectly indicated that the military leadership did not possess much understanding for the demands for a greater equality of languages in the Army. The argument used by the State Secretariat for People's Defence to support the need for the use of Serbo-Croatian language was misleading as well. The competent authorities stated the following fact as the reason for this: that "90 % of all senior officers currently employed in the Yugoslav People's Army belong to the nations speaking Serbo-Croatian".<span id="ftn678_return"><a class="notelink" title="SI AS 1589, IV, box 189, 436, Informacija o uporabi jezikov narodov in narodnosti v Jugoslovanski ljudski armadi." href="#ftn678"><sup>675</sup></a></span> The cause and consequence were obviously reversed here, because the high percentage of Serbian (and Croatian) speaking officers was the consequence of using only one language in the Army, not the reason for the use of this language.</p><p id="p-373"><span class="numberParagraph">23</span>It was characteristic of such statements, coming from the military circles, that during the preparation of plans of how to meet the demands for a greater equality of languages in the Army references were only made to the demands of the Federal Assembly resolution. The absence of any arguments associating the greater equality with an improved atmosphere in the Army and its enhanced battle efficiency was obvious.

In February 1974 – in the time when the new Yugoslav Constitution was adopted – the media only published praise about the broad possibilities for the further development of the country.
