The JSDS joined the new state community with modern and mostly democratic programme orientations, formed already in the Austrian period. Like other social democratic parties around Europe it represented especially the interests of the working class with the goal of asserting the social rights and protection of workers from ruthless exploitation. It argued for the democratisation of the political system and for the political cohabitation of all citizens, as substantiated with the universal suffrage. In this regard it emphasised that the workers' movement could attain its goals in an evolutionary manner, with gradual reforms as well as legal and parliamentary means of the struggle for power in the context of the bourgeois democracy. In its opinion democracy had an evident political and social dimension.<span id="ftn281_return"><a class="notelink" title="Zgodovinski arhiv Komunistične partije Jugoslavije.

The orientation of the new party, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) with Slovenian communists as its integral part, was determined by the Comintern guidelines. Immediately after the war as well as later, these encouraged revolutionary takeovers of power, as this was, among other things, set out in the "21 Conditions of Admission to the Communist International", which had a fatal impact on the differentiation of the global workers' movement.<span id="ftn282_return"><a class="notelink" title="Avgust Lešnik: Razcep v mednarodnem socializmu (1914–1923) [Division in International Socialism (1914–1923)].

Their immediate demands and goals were identical in many aspects. However, they differed significantly with regard to the path towards the realisation of the socio-political programme. This difference had a decisive impact on their outlook on the question of democracy and defined their positions in the socio-political space, since the willingness to cohabitate differed radically between these parties. The social democrats kept insisting that reforms leading to social changes should be undertaken in a parliamentary manner, in the context of the plural bourgeois democracy.

They emphasised that socialism could not be implemented in the context of the bourgeois democracy and parliamentary institutions, but rather only by means of workers' councils, because only the Soviet authority could protect the "true proletarian democracy" and the leading role of the industrial proletariat, to which the role of the ruling class belonged. Nevertheless, until the final assumption of power the communists intended to take advantage of the political rights in the bourgeois state, while emphasising that the KPJ was a "fundamental opponent of parliamentarism as a means of class government" and that after the proletarian takeover of power parliamentarism would no longer be possible.<span id="ftn287_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid." href="#ftn287"><sup>284</sup></a></span></p><p id="p-128"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>Both fractions of the Marxist workers' movement talked about socialism, but understood it differently. It was characteristic of the communists that they had a fundamentalist understanding of socialism as a non‑plural, totalitarian system, based on the dictatorship of a single social and political option. This already in its essence excluded parliamentarism and the possibility for cohabitation in general. On the other hand, the social democratic understanding of socialism did not reject the modern social institutions and achievements like parliamentarism and multi-party system, human rights and freedoms, market economy, rule of law, etc. Social democrats saw all of these suppositions of the modern society as indispensable in their perceptions of a socially just state.</p><p id="p-129"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>However, certain variations and specific emphases are discernable in the outlooks of the individual prominent personalities of the social democratic persuasion.

These two ideas were the essential elements of his opinions with regard to politics and society in general, and they are most closely interconnected.<span id="ftn288_return"><a class="notelink" title="Milan Zver: Demokracija v klasični slovenski politični misli [Democracy in the Classic Slovenian Political Thought].

In his analyses he established empirically that every class, once it attains the political power, "uses democracy for its own advantage, furthering its social agenda". Thus every democratic rule has its social contents. However, in democratic politics, in which all of the social strata participate, these contents are confirmed at democratic elections, where the majority decides. Therefore the nature of democracy may be bourgeois democratic, peasant democratic, or proletarian (socialist) democratic. We cannot only speak about democracy in the presence of harmony between the social and administrative or state power. Democratic states should rely exclusively on the existing social forces, and any violent redistribution of the state power, for example by means of the military, is unacceptable. If conflicts in the relationship between the state and society are obvious, we can only talk about a dictatorship. <a id="person-615"></a><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">Prepeluh</span></span><sup><a class="person" href="persons.html#pers-PrepeluhAlbin" title="List of persons: No. 615">[pers.]</a></sup> emphasised that Marxist socialism had always sought the support of democracy, that it wanted to take over the power only democratically, which is why the socialist parties endeavoured for universal suffrage and ascribed such a profound importance to the elections for the legislative and administrative corporations. He talked about the "dictatorship of democracy", which was what the socialist parties aspired to, but which was also substantially different from the Bolshevik dictatorship, "which may well call itself the dictatorship of the proletariat, but that does not make it true". He described the Russian system at the time as "despotic socialism", supported by a strong army but lacking the economic preconditions, which is why Russia had succumbed to a profound material poverty.</p><p id="p-131"><span class="numberParagraph">7</span><a id="person-616"></a><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">Alojzija Štebi</span></span><sup><a class="person" href="persons.html#pers-%C5%A0tebiAlojzija" title="List of persons: No. 616">[pers.]</a></sup>,<span id="ftn290_return"><a class="notelink" title="Alojzija Štebi, publicist, journalist, worked in various offices for social policy in Ljubljana and Belgrade as well as in the Feminist Alliance." href="#ftn290"><sup>287</sup></a></span> for a while a member of the JSDS, developed a special approach to the implementation of democratic principles.

In the time after the war women should especially become active in social matters, where they should replace the humiliating charity practices. Because of their maternal instincts they would, supposedly, successfully carry out a variety of tasks in the establishment of public life, participate in the state and municipal legislation and administration, all of this with the goal of strengthening the morality and enriching the life of the whole community. <a id="person-621"></a><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">Štebi</span></span><sup><a class="person" href="persons.html#pers-%C5%A0tebiAlojzija" title="List of persons: No. 621">[pers.]</a></sup> also believed that with their civil rights women would be able to remove the principle of force from the relationship between the nations, as this was supposedly still a heritage from the barbaric past.

The separation should also include schools, because it could not be in the interest of the state to bring up Orthodox, Catholic or Muslim citizens, and so on.

Thus it became the regional organisation of the SSJ for Slovenia, while on the other hand it split into several fractions in 1922 and 1923, which weakened its influence.

In its pre-election appearances the ZDL demanded the implementation of the widest possible self-management of the municipalities, abolishment of the State Protection Act, freedom of association, assurance of decent life for all citizens, etc. Despite the profound indignation of the liberals against the "immoral" association in Ljubljana, the Workers' List won with a significant majority.

With such political reorientation and with the appeals to democracy, simultaneously exhibiting the zeal so characteristic for the communists and taking advantage of various legal and semi-legal methods of operation, the KPJ started making its way into the public political life more prominently.<span id="ftn328_return"><a class="notelink" title="Zgodovina Zveze komunistov Jugoslavije [History of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia].

This resulted in the statement of the Communist Parties of Yugoslavia, Italy and Austria in April 1934 on the right of the Slovenian nation to self-determination, including the right to secede from the imperial countries and the right to its unification. The importance of taking the national question into account in order to ensure a successful organisation of the revolutionary struggle of the communists was also reflected in the decision of the Comintern that the Communist Parties of Slovenia and Croatia should be established in the context of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. The goal of this reorganisation was to ensure a more effective political participation of the oppressed nations' communist parties as national parties in the sense of a counterbalance to other national parties. In this regard it was also explicitly underlined that the internal organisational structure of the united KPJ would not change in any sense, and that it would still be based on its centralist foundations. The decision on the establishment of the Communist Party of Slovenia (KPS) was then adopted at the fourth state conference of the KPJ in December 1934, but it was not implemented until more than two years later.<span id="ftn331_return"><a class="notelink" title="Istorijski arhiv Komunističke partije Jugoslavije.

It demanded the introduction of democratic freedoms, abolishment of the January 6<sup itemprop="hi">th</sup> regime, termination of the economic exploitation of the Slovenian nation by the Greater Serbian centralism, as well as the convening of a democratically-elected Constitutional Assembly and Slovenian Parliament as a representative of the sovereignty of the Slovenian nation.
