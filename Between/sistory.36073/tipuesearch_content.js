{ "title": "Preface", "text": "The Second half of the 19 th and the entire 20 th century was a momentous period of European history and an era which wrought fundamental changes to the social, political, economic and cultural life of what was ultimately to become the Republic of Slovenia, together with the adjacent territories inhabited by ethnic Slovenes. New borders also cut swathes through the lands these people populated. In the aftermath of its 1866 defeat in the War against Italy, Austria ceded Venetia to Italy, thus causing ethnic Slovenes in Slavia Veneta (Beneška Slovenija) to become Italian citizens. A year later, as a consequence of constitutional changes, the Habsburg Empire was transformed into Austria-Hungary Monarchy. In the new dualist state, Slovenes living in Prekmurje and the Porabje were now governed by Hungary, while the majority of the nation remained Austrian subjects. Austria, Hungary and Italy thus came to provide the historical framework for the disparate social, political, economic and cultural development of contemporary ethnic Slovenes living in Central Europe. This period was characterized by the instigation of parliamentary democracy, entrepreneurial incentive, cultural exchange and ethnic friction between Slovenes and the neighbouring nations.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36284/preface.html#p-8" },

These minorities were briskly exposed to cultural assimilation, followed by Fascism in Italy (from 1922) and Nazism in Austria (after the 1938 Anschluss); likewise, Hungary displayed but little understanding the culture of their ethnic Slovene population.

The University of Ljubljana (established in 1919) together with the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (established in 1938) played an important role. Slovenes, furthermore, at times contributed importantly to the shaping of Yugoslav politics. The classical multi-party parliamentary system which had developed during the 1920s, came to an end in 1929 with the suspension of the constitution and the introduction of dictatorship, nominally headed by the Yugoslav King. During the second half of the 1930s two pan-Yugoslav political organizations were active in the country; the domestic political environment, however, flourished, as did the economy. Indeed, industry and manufacturing developed most extensively across Slovenian territory, and manufactures found ready markets across the rest of Yugoslavia.

The Axis invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1941 marked the onset of a crucial struggle for the very survival and emancipation of the Slovene nation; its whole territory was rapidly occupied – namely by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Horthy's Hungary – and thence annexed and dismembered. In Europe, only Greece had a similar fate. Within the totalitarian and racist new order created by the Axis powers there was obviously no room for Slovenes as either a national or political subject. Through the expansion of their borders, all three Axis occupiers intended the long-term eradication of Slovenian nation as an ethnic entity, and although their timeframe, methods and strategies in achieving this goal differed, Slovenian historiography applies the term ethnocide to describe the fate intended for ethnic Slovenes.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36284/preface.html#p-13" },

This manifesto gave Slovenes, as well as all the other Yugoslav nations, some important attributes of statehood; indeed, within this emergent entity and its latter incarnations Democratic Federal Yugoslavia (in 1945); the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia (in 1946); and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1963–1992). Slovenes had their own federal nation within Yugoslavia. Consequent to the Axis defeat, and thence under the terms of the 1947 Paris Peace Treaty, the Slovenian Littoral – annexed to Italy from 1920 – was ceded to Yugoslavia. The new Socialist Federal Republic was henceforth home to more than ninety per cent of Europe’s ethnic Slovenes, and its importance increased as a consequence.

Because the concept helps us include an important dimension of social and political practices significant for the comprehension of various processes that could be overlooked by a general historiographical analysis of democratization, modernization, parliamentarism and political/ideological struggles. What do we mean with the concept of coexistence? We are using the term as a conceptual tool for the analysis of the processes of (dis)regard and inclusion/exclusion practised by social and political groups. Let us define social groups in a broader sense: as communities of people who acknowledge the existence of these communities and their affiliation with them. This definition does not imply anything about the homogeneity and margins of these groups. Richard Jenkins : Social Identity .

{ "title": "Coexistence and Democracy in General", "text": "We are also using the concept of coexistence because it complements other concepts necessary to understand such processes, e.g. modernization, parliamentarism, pluralism, liberalism, representation and – of course – democracy. Of all the concepts listed, the latter is perhaps the most heterogeneous and yet crucial for the period following the revolutions of the 17 th and 18 th centuries. We cannot delve into a detailed analysis of the concept of democracy in time and space at this time; if we want to understand the relationship between coexistence and democracy in early 20 th century, however, it is necessary to know some of the fundamental shifts in the meaning of the concept. Before the revolutionary period, only theoretical treatises ever used the concept of democracy. The great majority of theoreticians stuck to Aristotle's logic, according to which democracy was unachievable in large countries and only possible in small political entities if certain conditions are met. Democracy was understood to only mean the direct (pure, absolute) democracy of the idealized Athenian type where everybody (the whole demos) decides upon everything. Hans Maier : Demokratie, III. Auflösung der Tradition in der frühen Neuzeit. In: Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe , Band 1 . Stuttgart, 1979, p. 839 . The great political philosophers of the 17 th and 18 th centuries who are generally regarded as the fathers of the modern conception of politics saw the biggest issue with democracy in the feuding of different factions. Montesquieu was convinced that the republican rule may be either aristocratic or democratic. However, the main precondition for the existence of a republican government according to Montesquieu was public virtue – a desire for the common good – of the ruling people. If the virtue is practically absent in despotism and unnecessary in a monarchy, it is crucial to the operation of a republic. Robert A. Dahl : Democracy. In: Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite. Encyclopaedia Britannica . Chicago, 2010, p. 23 . Without a clear awareness of striving for the common good, the republic would dissolve in the struggles of various factions. The destructiveness of factions was also stressed by David Hume who preferred the concept of the republic to that of democracy. Hume resolved the problem of feuding factions by advocating representation of people from larger political entities. In his opinion, representatives of the people from larger entities would have to consider a broader range of interests, reducing the possibility of feuding between factions. Rousseau was even more critical of democracy. In The Social Contract, Rousseau upheld the belief that democracy was incompatible with representative institutions. According to Rousseau , the sovereignty of the people may not be taken away or represented. Ibid., pp. 24–25 . Of all these philosophers, John Locke had the most faith in representative democracy, supporting (albeit ambiguously) the idea of a representative democracy. Ibid., p. 21 . Democracy got a new dimension with the creation of the USA and with the French Revolution. The idea of representing the people allowed for the implementation of democracy in large countries. However, the idea of representatives being elected by the people was accompanied by two fundamental problems: the inevitability of parties (movements, factions) and the question of the electorate. Both are central to the issue of the coexistence of differences.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36285/ch01.html#p-22" },
{ "title": "Coexistence and Democracy in General", "text": "The fact that the term democracy had freed itself from the grasp of social theory and started a political life of its own is also of some significance. Democracy thus came to mean more than it used to in the constitutional/political sense. It became a self-descriptive word for many different political groups and a name for new constitutional institutions. Most of all though, the concept was expanded with general social and historical/philosophical content. This led to concepts such as social democracy, Christian democracy, etc. Maier , Demokratie, p. 848 . In the 19 th century, as the advent of the bourgeois society coincided with the idea of popular representation gradually but surely becoming dominant and realized within state institutions (parliament), democracy came to mean unmanageably many things. Different breeds of radicals of various national convictions in 1848, such as the emerging socialists and conservatives, understood it differently from each other. The term democracy had a special relationship with liberalism as a political movement and as an ideology of the bourgeoisie. The form of political organization typical of liberalism was the representative government based on an elected parliament that did not represent social interests or communities (as it was under the old regime) but rather groups of legally equal individuals. Eric Hobsbawm : The Age of Capital 1848–1875 . London, 2008 (1975), p. 123 . Behind the principles of personal freedoms, the constitution, the rule of law and parliamentary representation espoused by liberal movements there was always the issue of the participation of the masses in political decision-making. However, the liberals at the top did not trust the masses to be capable of rational political decisions. What to do? Limit the right to vote and act as popular representatives, as those who know what is best for the people. Alan S. Kahan : Liberalism in Nineteenth-Century Europe. The Political Culture of Limited Suffrage . New York, 2003, p. 8 . As pointed out by Pieter M. Judson , few European liberals were ready to extend suffrage to lower classes, both in the United Kingdom and in France, as well in German and Austrian areas. Pieter M.

{ "title": "Coexistence and Democracy in General", "text": "The theories of democracy that had developed in Western Europe and in the U.S. in the latter decades of the 20 th century and that remain relevant even today do not pay much attention to the matter of coexistence. This is partly due to the fact that they deal with democracy as a political system and partly to the fact that the question of coexistence is supposedly embedded in the very system of democracy. Most of these definitions of democracy are multi-dimensional. E.g. Juan J. Linz and Alfred C. Stepan point out five aspects that should exist in consolidated democracies: a free civil society, an autonomous and valued political community, the rule of law, a comparatively efficient bureaucracy and an institutionalized political society. Bruce Bueno De Mesquita, George W. Downs , Alastair Smith and Feryal Marie Cherif : Thinking inside the Box. A Closer Look at Democracy and Human Rights. International Studies Quarterly , 2005, No. 3, p. 441 . A similarly multi-dimensional view of democracy is given by one of its foremost theorists Robert A. Dahl . At the very minimum, an ideal democracy should comprise: effective participation of the demos (members of the entity should be able to voice their political opinions), equality of elections, informed voters, a civil control over the functioning of the government (the demos decides what is important for the representatives' decision-making), involvement (everybody is free to participate) and fundamental rights. Dahl , Democracy, p. 23 . Dahl's thesis that carries the most weight for our subject matter is that one element of a democracy cannot stand in for another. E.g.: a high level of political participation cannot compensate for unfree elections. Bueno De Mesquita , Downs , Smith and Cherif , Thinking inside the Box, p. 442 . However, democracy is not just a political system, it is also a system of values. This aspect is particularly emphasized by American political/legal scholar Robert Post , who states that democracy should not immediately be equated with the sovereignty of the people, i.e. the situation where the people wield ultimate control over their government. Such control may instead go hand in hand with popular fascism in which the dictator enjoys the spontaneous support of the majority. Similarly, democracy does not equal majority rule, a system where the government is controlled by the majority. The majority of the electorate can force the adoption of undemocratic rules. Democracy is different from sovereignty of the people and majority rule because democracy is a normative idea associated with substantial political values, while sovereignty of the people and majority rule are descriptive terms that apply to individual decision-making processes.

{ "title": "Coexistence and Democracy in General", "text": "Two perspectives on democracy are particularly important for the history of our area and often ignored by authors from the West: the Marxist view and the Catholic view. However, the subject of relationships between democracy and Marxism and democracy and Catholicism is too complex for the scope of this article. The Catholic Church, as the most stable community conceived in pre-modern age, did not greet democracy with open arms. In continental Europe, parliamentary democracy was born out of revolution and secularization. The pluralism of political groups ran counter to the idea of a hierarchical, harmonious country. Egon Pelikan : Akomodacija ideologije političnega katolicizma na Slovenskem [Accommodation of the Political Catholicism Ideology in Slovenia]. Maribor, 1997, p. 40 . However, ideologues of political Catholicism were quick to realize the signs of the times and were forced to accept the uncomfortable fact that it was necessary for them to enter the plural political sphere as well. Because Catholicism, which established itself as a bastion against godless modernization in the 19 th century, used modern means to mobilize people, it had to modernize itself as well, at least to a certain degree. Democratic structures invaded Catholicism through societies and associations, through the press, through political parties, unions, Catholic manifestations, etc. Laymen started playing an increasingly significant role in the structure of the Church. Ernst Hanisch : Der politische Katholizismus, Staat und Kirche in Österreich von 1919 bis zur Gegenwart. In: Oto Luthar and Jurij Perovšek (eds.), Zbornik Janka Pleterskega [A Collection of Texts by Janko Pleterski ]. Ljubljana, 2003, p. 528 . As clearly showed by Egon Pelikan , political Catholicism had an ambivalent attitude towards democracy, wavering between various shades of total rejection of constitutionality/parliamentarism and a deep confidence in the power of the people, between a pure monarchic principle and the glorification of universal suffrage. In general, however, Catholic theorists were using all available philosophical and sociological means to reconcile democracy with the Catholic model of an organic hierarchical community, usually according to the logic that democracy is acceptable only if it is true, i.e. Catholic.

{ "title": "Coexistence and Democracy in General", "text": "If the static nature of the Catholic view of society precluded coexistence with groups with significantly different world views, the dialectic nature of Marxist thought led to coexistence taking a back seat to class struggle. Marx and Engels (in their mature phase) considered the system of liberal democracy to be a tool of the bourgeoisie masquerading as representative of the whole society but in truth using democracy to protect capitalist exploitation. The bourgeois equality (elimination of class privileges) is very different from the proletarian equality (elimination of classes themselves). Friedrich Engels : Gospoda Evgena Dühringa prevrat v znanosti ( Anti-Dühring ). Ljubljana, 1948, p. 399 . Marx and Engels see liberal democracy through the glasses of teleology and dialectics: as a process leading from democracy to social democracy and then the revolutionary leap, which finally opens the door to the true democracy of communism. Werner Conze : Demokratie in der Modernen Bewegung. In: Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe , Band 1 . Stuttgart, 1979, p. 891 . Unlike Leninism, Austromarxism was not opposed to parliamentary struggle. The working class not only has no reason to abandon parliamentarism, thus believed Karl Kautsky , it has unquestionable reason to resolutely do everything in its power to strengthen the parliament against the state administration and to strengthen its representation in the parliament. Karl Kautsky : Temeljna načela socialne demokracije . Ljubljana, 1912, p. 57 . The focus is not on the principle of coexistence but rather on the struggle for the inevitable victory of the proletariat followed by the elimination of capitalist relations and private property. In light of Slovenian history, we must mention Kardelj's conception of democracy and pluralism. Following Marx , Kardelj treats bourgeois parliamentarism as a tool of the bourgeoisie that muddles the true classist essence of the system of capitalism. Edvard Kardelj : Smeri razvoja političnega sistema socialističnega samoupravljanja [Development Orientations of the Socialist Self-Management Political System]. Ljubljana, 1977, p. 41 . According to Kardelj , true democracy is not a list of formal rights but is rather rooted in appropriate socio-economic relations. In the context of the system of self-governing democracy, pluralism is not realized as a monopoly of political parties but rather as a pluralism of self-governing interests through various socio-political and other organizations. As most social interests are not politicized in the relations of socialist self-government, there is also no need for political parties. Ibid., pp. 96–97 . In principle, Kardelj is not opposed to the coexistence of different social interests, but only as long as they fit his system. According to Kardelj , in order to preserve the freedom and democratic rights of the great majority of people working in the system of self-government and directing the society (through delegates), freedom and activity must be limited for those social forces that wish to abolish our freedom.

{ "title": "Coexistence and the Contemporary Slovenian Press", "text": "The aim of this article is simple: to contextualize the matter of political coexistence in early 20 th century Slovenia. Why is this important? Slovenian press (and to a lesser degree historiography) is extremely partial to the idea of Slovenian divisiveness. Authors of various convictions and leanings see divisiveness as something a priori Slovenian, as a typical Slovenian trait. Let us look at a couple of examples. For instance, in his interpretation of Slovenian history, France Bučar posited that discrimination according to ideology was characteristic of the whole duration of our national consciousness. Supposedly, a distinctive feature of Slovenian society at the beginning of the 21 st century are the divisions that had been created in the past. Bučar identifies the fact that Slovenian national consciousness developed through proclamations of Catholicism as an element of the national essence as the central problem in this regard. According to Bučar , any association with tendencies not originating in Catholicism (e.g. liberalism, socialism) was seen as disloyalty to the nation. This intolerance to anything even slightly different was supposedly exploited by communism that abused the emancipatory pattern of the Liberation Front to achieve domination and restore the old principle of division. France Bučar : Slovenci in prihodnost. Slovenski narod po rojstvu države [Slovenians and the Future. Slovenian Nation after the Birth of the State]. Ljubljana, 2009, pp. 101–103 . Fighting between liberals and clericals was also the subject of Marcel Štefančič Jr. , a journalist for Mladina, who stated that the Slovenian situation in late 19 th century amounted to civil war. At the time, Slovenia was supposedly acutely, intensely, brutally polarized. /…/ Although blood was not flowing, ink certainly was. Štefančič sees liberal anti-Catholic propaganda as a reaction to the intolerance of the Catholic faction. Marcel Štefančič : Slovenci [Slovenians]. Ljubljana, 2010, p. 32 . Theologian and philosopher Janez Juhant has a completely different idea of the Slovenian divisiveness in this period. Due to their entanglement in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, Slovenes supposedly found a safe haven in the Church. The Church became a mother of the nation and came to define the nation's existence. The development of democracy in the context of modernity was thus supposedly frustrated by liberalism and communism by limiting themselves to the culture war.

{ "title": "Coexistence and the Contemporary Slovenian Press", "text": "What is the common denominator of all these extremely different views of the Slovenian schism? It is primarily their unhistorical perspective, i.e. the assessment of historical development from today's perspective, from the viewpoint of the observer who is familiar with the future stages of development. However, such a viewpoint is only seemingly broad. In truth, it obscures important issues that are essential to the historiographical interpretation and can only be caught if we are very familiar with the characteristics of the space and time under investigation. The people who lived then did not know what we know now. Another characteristic common to all the above views is the near (or complete) absence of the national and social contexts. The Habsburg Monarchy is presented as a kind of stage on which the history of Slovenian disputes is unfolding, not as an important factor whose mere structure of government determined various parameters of development (cultural, political, economic). A perennialist idea of the nation is also frequently typical: that nations supposedly existed in all historical period even though nationalist ideology is of a much later date. Although the author treats nationalism as a modern phenomenon, he is also well aware of the importance of the ethnosymbolic perspective (prehistory of the nation). A brief overview of theories of nationalism. In: Christian Jansen and Henning Borggräfe : Nation, Nationalität, Nationalismus . Frankfurt, New York, 2007 . Such analyses often hide a very contemporary secret message between the lines (e.g. clericals/liberals were evil/good in the past, so they are still evil/good). Another typical feature of these authors is their investigation of who was more responsible for the culture war and whose contributions to Slovenian history were positive/negative. History is life's teacher, after all. Regardless of the potentially opposite intentions of their authors, such interpretations reproduce the myth of Slovenian divisiveness by newly constructing it through criticism. The author of this article does not wish to insinuate that the journalist viewpoint or the viewpoints of other humanities are wrong. Journalism (or political, philosophical, theological, literary analysis) can uncover many things that the historian would overlook. However, this is not a historical analysis but rather something else. In parallel with the journalist, i.e. non-historical conceptualization of political divisions in early 20 th century, there exists a developing discipline of academic historiography that deals with the issues of political coexistence in broad temporal and spatial contexts. In the next section, we will refer to this tradition and complement it with a list of comparative historiography monographs dealing with the Habsburg Monarchy.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36285/ch01.html#p-28" },

The complexity of the government system as well as general social circumstances in the country commonly called the old Austria places heavy obstacles before the historian. There are many reasons for this: the Habsburg context is not singular – rather, there are multiple contexts to the development of the Slovenian political and general social spheres. There is also the question of whether the historian of today is even able to understand the institutions of that time, e.g. the unclear relationship between provincial and state jurisdiction, Cf.

{ "title": "Political Culture", "text": "The concept of political culture in the context of Central European history was defined in a book by Austrian historian Ernst Hanisch , and in the context of Slovenian historiography it is used convincingly by Peter Vodopivec . According to Hanisch , political culture is an amalgam of tendencies, attitudes and relations towards political processes and structures. One part of political culture are the behavioural patterns that are transmitted through symbols and traditions. Political culture is the politically relevant idea of the world held by populations, major social groups and functional elites. Peter Vodopivec : Politične in zgodovinske tradicije v srednji Evropi in na Balkanu (v luči izkušnje prve Jugoslavije) [Political and Historical Traditions in the Central Europe and the Balkans (in View of the Experience from the First Yugoslavia)]. Zgodovinski časopis , 2005, No. 3–4, pp. 461–462 . Hanisch's basic idea is evident from the very title of his book on 20 th century Austrian history (The Long Shadow of the State). According to Hanisch's interpretation, a strong tradition of state bureaucracy had developed in Austria. Modernization was usually handled from top to bottom and the civil society never completely shook off the influence of the state. On the other hand, the traditions of state bureaucracy was supposedly precisely the element that allowed for a relatively early development of the social state. Ernst Hanisch : Der lange Schatten des Staates. Österreichische Gesellschaftgeschichte im 20. Jahrhundert. Österreichische Geschichte 1890–1990 . Vienna, 1994, p. 15 . According to Hanisch , political culture of the Monarchy was at odds with the civil and representation-oriented Anglo-Saxon political culture of the time. Peter Vodopivec : O slovenskih političnih tradicijah v času nastanka Kraljevine SHS leta 1918 [On the Slovenian Political Traditions during the Establishment of the Kingdom of SHS in 1918]. In: Problemi demokracije na Slovenskem , p. 2 . It was impossible to truly develop political individualism. This was partly also due to Austrian popular culture that was shot through with Catholicism. In late 19 th century, the latter reformed into a defensive ideology that stood against modernization. The ideology's proclaimed main adversaries were liberals, social democrats and Jews. Catholicism's closed value system referred to the eternal order of Heaven, nature and society, which of course presupposes respect for tradition and authority. Hanisch , Der lange Schatten des Staates , p. 30 . Vodopivec , Politične in zgodovinske tradicije, p. 465 . In Hanisch's opinion, the roots of Austrian political culture were formed even before the 19 th century, during the time of Baroque and Josephinism. The Baroque period supposedly left its mark on the Austrian sphere by encouraging the development of a rigid social hierarchy, ceremonies and theatrics and a roundabout way of speaking, as well as increasing the importance of personal connections to one's career. Hanisch , Der lange Schatten des Staates , p. 27 . The other, more reasonable part of political culture was the result of Josephinism, however, the aim of the enlightened-absolutist reforms of Joseph II was not to form a community of free citizens but rather a unified association of subjects. Top-to-bottom modernization created a powerful bureaucracy that had no qualms about interfering with the personal lives of the subjects.

{ "title": "Political Culture", "text": "In historiography, the matter of political culture in the Habsburg Monarchy is connected to the great debate on Germany's special path, the Sonderweg, that, in the late 20 th century, raged throughout the German historiography of the 19 th and 20 th centuries. The proponents of the special path hypothesis explained the rise of National Socialism with the special, conservative modernization of Germany, in which the successful socio-economic modernization was not followed by an effective political modernization that would lead towards modern democracy. The rule of old, traditional elites supposedly blocked the parliamentarization of the system. The Sonderwegdebatte had various twists and turns, however, we cannot simply divide its participants into proponents and opponents of the special path hypothesis. That is, various proponents of the Sonderweg had very different interpretations of it. According to American historian James Shedel , the heart of the special path hypothesis is the conviction that France, Great Britain and the U.S. represent the normative development models, meaning that the progressiveness of other countries should be measured by their success at implementing the fundamental characteristics of these models. James Shedel : Fin de siècle or Jahrhundertwende. The Question of an Austrian Sonderweg. In: Rethinking Vienna 1900 . New York, Oxford, 2001, p. 84 . Critics of the German special path question the relationship between the German and Western-European development: the normal path of social and political transformation does not exist, and although the German middle class wielded relatively little influence at the level of state politics, it was dominant in the social, economic and cultural spheres. Cf. the introduction to Geoff Eley and David Blackbourn : The Peculiarities of German History, Bourgeois Society and Politics in Nineteenth-Century Germany . Oxford, 1984, pp. 1–39 . The Austrian version of the Sonderweg of course has its own characteristics. However, there is the background question that historians have been asking since 1918: Was the Habsburg Monarchy destined to fall? And of course: Why? For a brief overview of historians' opinions on the inevitability of the Monarchy's downfall, see Janez Cvirn : Zwittrov pogled na habsburško monarhijo [ Zwitter's Outlook on the Habsburg Monarchy]. In: Zwittrov zbornik [Collection of Texts on Zwitter ]. Ljubljana, 2008, pp. 35–46 . As shown by Shedel , many historians, those writing before ( Josef Redlich ) as well as those writing after World War II ( Hugo Hantch , Erich Zöllner , Robert A. Kann ), rationalized the problems of the Habsburg Monarchy by the failure of true constitutionality in 1848/89, which caused the Monarchy to miss the opportunity to transform into a healthy federal state based on liberal principles, and by the country's unsuccessful resolution of national disputes. The most famous proponent of the Austrian special path, cultural historian Carl Schorske , believed that Austria as a society plunged into a crisis in the late 19 th century because of the decline of liberalism and the rise of Christian socialists, social democrats, anti-Semites and nationalists. These supposedly prevented the rational culture of the law espoused by the haute bourgeoisie from flourishing. According to Schorske , this had a good side as well: disappointed by politics, the children of liberal parents discovered intellectual inspiration. And thus developed the cultural phenomenon known as the Fin-de-siècle Vienna. Shedel , The Question of an Austrian Sonderweg, pp. 86–88 . Cf. Carl E.

{ "title": "Political Culture", "text": "In his book, Hanisch asks whether the special path model could also be used for Austrian history. Although he does not give a clear answer to this question, it is evident that he is, in his careful way, quite partial to the concept of an Austrian Sonderweg. It is also obvious that the political culture of Western Europe serves as his comparative reference point. He often mentions delayed development of various nationalisms and democracy: The political religion of various nationalisms functioned according to the politics of emotion and replaced the cool rationality of liberalism. Their remorseless populist demagogy rendered the new democratic political elites incapable of compromise.

{ "title": "Political Culture", "text": "The distinctive features of the Austrian path are being researched by historians who are openly critical of the Sonderweg as well. Shedel concedes that the historical development of the Monarchy was distinctive – not abnormal but simply different from the development of Western Europe. Robin Okey has a similar view of the processes of modernization within the Monarchy: Habsburg Monarchy from Enlightenment to Eclipse . New York, 2000, p. 400 . Shedel stresses the significance of legal order and the idea of a state of law (Rechtsstaat), the heritage of Josephinism that had formed the basis of the political culture. The rationalist and legalist spirit of the Enlightenment was an important source of lawfulness for the dynasty as well as an indispensable tool for the management of the Monarchy. Shedel , The Question of an Austrian Sonderweg, p. 94 . If the state support for modernization stalled in the post-Josephine period, the revolution of 1848 sent the dynasty back to the top-to-bottom implementation of various processes of modernization (economy, education). Due to military defeats, financial troubles and opposition of the bourgeoisie, the Monarchy was even forced into making constitutional concessions. Vodopivec , Politične in zgodovinske tradicije, p. 463 . The constitution of December 1867 can thus be seen as a compromise (far-reaching authority of the ruler). According to Rumpler , the December Constitution strengthened the legal foundation of the Monarchy, however, it did not establish a constitutional state (in the Western sense) but rather bolstered the Rechtsstaat, i.e. the legally regulated execution of state powers. Helmut Rumpler : Österreichische Geschichte 1804–1914. Eine Chance für Mitteleuropa, Bürgerliche Emazipation und Staatsverfall in der Habsburgermonarchie . Vienna, 1997, p. 417 . This allowed the society to function normally in the periods of the hung parliament after 1897. As stressed by Hanisch , the mutual blockade of political powers did not threaten the privileges of the Crown or the domination of state bureaucracy. According to Shedel , the parties of the parliament often supported the rule of bureaucracy according to Article 14 during the periods of parliamentary impotence – meaning that they respected the traditional functioning of the Rechtsstaat as a legitimate, useful and powerful force even in the constitutional period.

{ "title": "Civil Society", "text": "In addition to the concept of political culture, the concept of civil society is another recent addition to historiography. This concept is championed by American historian Gary B. Cohen who notes that nationalist historiographies traditionally tended to present the national political movements within the Monarchy as independent of or counter to the state. However, the Habsburg Monarchy actually enabled the creation of political and institutional spaces necessary for the development of the modern civil society – along with nationalist politics. Cohen understands the concept of civil society in a broader, though not teleological sense: as a sphere of individual and collective discourses and actions, formally independent of the state that deals with public matters, politics and government. In the context of the 19 th century, civil society includes public associations, magazines and newspapers, voluntary societies, civil activities, political movements and, last but not least, political parties. Gary B. Cohen : Nationalist Politics and the Dynamics of State and Civil Society in the Habsburg Monarchy. Central Europan History , 2007, No. 2, p. 245 . It is the belief of this article's author that the concepts of political culture and civil society are not opposites, as are not the general concepts of culture and society. Cohen's conception of the civil society as a methodological aid for dealing with the history of the Habsburg Monarchy generally points towards the study of relationships between individuals, social groups and state institutions, while the concept of political culture is focused on long-term cultural patterns that are transmitted from generation to generation. In other words: The concept of political culture is closer to philosophy, while the concept of civil society is closer to sociology.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36285/ch01.html#p-35" },

John W. Boyer : Some Reflections on the Problem of Austria, Germany and Mitteleuropa. Central Europan History , 1989, pp. 11–12 . Already in Metternich's time, various societies and associations began appearing as a characteristic of the bourgeois way of life, and the number of newspapers likewise increased. The revolution of 1848 naturally resulted in an explosion of daily newspapers and the beginning of the formation of political parties. Although the state greatly limited the freedom of the press during the period of neo-absolutism, it also tried to use it to manipulate public opinion. The liberal acts on societies and the press from 1859/61 and 1867 respectively treated the right of association as one of the fundamental freedoms. Helmut Rumpler : Von der Bürgerlichen öffentlichkeit zur Massendemokratie. Zivilgesellschaft und politische partizipation im Vielvölkerstaat der Habsburgermonarchie. In: Die Habsburgermonarchie 1848–1918 , Band VIII, 1. Teilband . Vienna, 2006, p. 9 . As for the political sphere, the 1860s saw the development of political parties of patricians who staffed parliamentary bodies based on limited suffrage. Regardless, notes Cohen , the civil society by and large extended beyond the fences of limited suffrage. The development of industry, capitalist agriculture, urbanization and an increase in the level of education led to increased participation of the petty bourgeoisie and the working class in the affairs of civil society. Cohen , Nationalist Politics and the Dynamics of State and Civil Society, p. 249 . Following the European standards of the time, the Austrian half of the Monarchy provided its citizens with far-reaching freedoms of speech, press and association after 1867. Additionally, citizens were guaranteed impartial treatment by the courts. Various mass movements were thus able to openly develop oppositional policies and lay foundations for their activities in the period when the electoral system became more democratic. Ibid., p. 252 .

In many areas of internal affairs, state administration faced bottom-up pressure from the civil society, while senior officials struggled to retain the tradition of state administration from the top down.

{ "title": "Radicalization", "text": "In Slovenian history, the early 20 th century is justifiably regarded as a time of political divisions. However, it was also a time of (incomplete) democratization and mass politics (or politics of the masses). Cf. Vodopivec , O slovenskih političnih tradicijah, p. 30 . Hobsbawm points out that after 1870, the European ruling elites recognized that democratization was inevitable. The electorate started to expand. Universal and equal suffrage for men was spreading through Europe, with the matter of women's suffrage gaining increasing traction as well. This naturally resulted in the political mobilization of the masses and in the creation of parties of the masses. However, these parties of the masses did not replace patrician politics – patricians merely had to adapt to the new circumstances. Well-organized mass political movements were not republics of equals. The combination of hierarchical organization and mass popular support provided these parties with great potential: such parties became potential states. Democratization, occurring in the time of great social transformations and crises, brought about new problems. The unity (and even the existence) of various countries came to be questioned due to ineffectual parliaments, demagogy and insurmountable disputes between parties. Men of independent wealth were being pushed out of politics by men who had founded their careers and wealth on success in the new political environment. Eric Hobsbawm : The Age of Empire 1875–1914 . London, 2008, p. 96 . Parliamentary crises became part of everyday politics. From 1875 to 1914, France had as many as 52 governments, only 11 of which lasted more than a year. Cf. Robert Gildea : Children of the Revolution. The French 1799–1914 . London, 2008, pp. 247–288 . However, parliamentary disputes were not limited to countries with governments that depended upon them. In 1870s, Germany, where the government was appointed by the Kaiser and the parliament was elected on the basis of universal men's suffrage, was being undermined by the dispute between Bismarck's government and the Catholic Church. The culture war unified Catholic voters and helped create the first German people's party with strong backing among all classes – the Catholic Zentrum. Jost Dülfer : Deutschland als Kaiserreich (1871–1918). In: Deutsche Geschichte von den Anfängen bis zur Gegenwart . Frankfurt am Main, 2006, p. 557 . Social democratic parties were on the warpath, agitating during this time for universal and equal suffrage (including women) and simultaneously establishing mechanisms for permanent political campaign and a closed subculture (constant presence in the lives of supporters). A similar path – though from an ideologically opposite starting point – was taken by Christian socialist parties in Catholic countries. Geoff Eley : Forging Democracy . Oxford, 2002, p. 113 . In 1870s, domination of classical liberal parties at the European level was slowly coming to an end, which was also the result of the great depression and the related social issues (that had been pressing even before the crisis). Hobsbawm , The Age of Empire , p. 98 . In some countries, social liberals campaigning for a reformist correction of capitalism eventually gained power (Great Britain, Italy), while in others (e.g. in the German Empire) they failed to gain a relevant level of influence despite successes in non-governmental areas (creation of co-operatives).

{ "title": "Radicalization", "text": "It therefore seems that radicalization of politics within the parliamentary system was generally characteristic of the whole of Europe. However, the Austrian part of the Habsburg Monarchy was, in addition to ideological and social divisions, also plagued by national ones. Exacerbated conflicts and political instability were not only the result of nationalist sentiments as an independent factor, but rather of a transformation of civil society and the sphere of politics. The radicalization of nationalist politics was just one consequence of these transformations. Cohen , Nationalist Politics and the Dynamics of State and Civil Society, p. 266 . National disputes in Austria were not merely processes of destruction and divergence, they were also emancipatory and integrative, and after 1867, they changed the state in such a way that the bourgeoisies of all nations became masters of their own political destiny. Boyer , Culture and Political Crisis in Vienna , p. Xii . After 1890, mass political movements within the Monarchy threatened the positions of established parties of wealthy landowners, the conservative clergy and the moneyed and educated bourgeoisie. These new movements challenged the notions of the community espoused by the old conservatives and liberals, replacing them with their own populist conception of society/community, regardless of whether they were the proponents of radical nationalism and anti-Semitism, Catholic or secular agrarianism, urban social Catholicism or social democracy. Cohen , Nationalist Politics and the Dynamics of State and Civil Society, p. 267 . Particularly hard-hit were the German liberals, who dominated the Austrian part of the Monarchy as the ruling formation until 1879. The German liberals espoused a pluralist vision, according to which individuals must be free to develop their own potentials. However, as noted by Judson , the individual's choice was limited to the possibilities available within the context of the German bourgeoisie. The liberals' problem was not that they did not (in a certain sense) expand the rights to new groups of people, but rather that they made these rights too conditional: Have these rights, but be like us. Other groups preferred to fight for their rights on their own terms, for which they used the basic political structures left behind by the German liberals. Judson , Exclusive Revolutionaries , pp. 268, 269 . The fall of liberalism was not sudden. After (different) Central European liberals claimed for decades that they represent the common interest, it became increasingly clear after 1880 that they in truth represent nobody but themselves. The German liberals jumped on the wagon that they had been following for decades: integral German nationalism. They were thus able to preserve the role of their parties deep within the period of mass politics, especially in nationally mixed areas. Ibid., pp. 193, 194 .

Ljubljana, 2006, p. 144 . mass movements started dominating the political sphere. A point of interest in the Austrian case, according to John W. Boyer , is the fact that the crisis of political liberalism was the result of the invasion of civil movements that represented the middle of the bourgeoisie. Boyer , Culture and Political Crisis in Vienna , p. X . In Vienna, middle class politics was (along with anti-Semitism) one of the common points of Lueger's Christian Socialists and Schönerer's anti-Catholic pan-German movement. Movements that would supposedly protect the middle class were against both socialism and capitalism. Although middle class proved hard to define (it seemed to include both the mill owner and the junior clerk, but not the manual worker or the rich capitalist), the middle class ideology created a strong sense of belonging in the middle. Lothar Höbelt : Well-tempered Discontent: Austrian Domestic Politics. In: Cornwall (ed.), The last Years of Austria-Hungary , p. 54 . However, a separate sense of belonging was also cultivated by the Social Democrats who were becoming the foremost proponents of anti-Clericalism in the capital. The rise of the Social Democrats in Vienna showed that the political and ethical power of the working class had turned against the interests of other bourgeois classes, even the middle ones. Red workers' organizations opposed the Viennese bourgeoisie in the cultural sense as well – they espoused cultural egalitarianism that the middle classes did not agree with. John W.

The new national parties focused less on the fight against national enemies and more on the battle with established parties within national camps.

{ "title": "Radicalization", "text": "Unfortunately for Austrian parliamentarism, however, the quarrelling parties within national camps were able to stand united in the National Assembly. The parliamentary crisis due to Badeni's language ordinances for Bohemia and Moravia in 1897 and the brutality of parliamentary obstruction as well as riots within and outside the parliament became a symbol of the impotency of the parties and the political system. Cvirn , Razvoj ustavnosti in parlamentarizma , p. 187 . Rumpler , Eine Chance , p. 513 . Hanisch , Der lange Schatten des Staates , p. 230 . For more details on the Badeni Crisis, see Berthold Sutter : Die Badenische Sprachenverordnungen von 1897. Ihre Genesis und ihre Auswirkungen vornehmlich auf die inneröstereichischen Alpenländer , I and II . Graz, Cologne, 1960–65 . The crisis also brought the art of parliamentary obstruction to a higher level: obstruction became an everyday means used in order to achieve concrete political goals. Various parties obstructed the functioning of the parliament in order to obtain certain concessions, returning to normal political practice only when they got what they wanted. The other face of the Cisleithanian political system in the final decades of the Monarchy was represented by the complex mechanisms of political negotiation between the parties and state administration that allowed the latter to function. Among the more successful ones was the Moravian Compromise of 1905. Cvirn , Razvoj ustavnosti in parlamentarizma , p. 196 . The notorious Article 14, which allowed the adoption of legislation without the parliament, played a part in the negotiations as well. Article 14 could only be used when the parliament was not in session. Once the parliament reconvened, the government had to present it with all the acts it had adopted in accordance with Article 14. These acts were often passed by the parliament as well. According to Lothar Höbelt , extraordinary acts passed by the government often broke the stalemate in the parliament and opened doors to negotiations and productive legislative work. Cohen , Nationalist Politics and the Dynamics of State and Civil Society, p. 270 . Although the implementation of universal suffrage for men effected by the reform of 1906 changed the balance of power (increasing the number of workers' and peasants' representatives), it did not wholly eliminate the unequal representation of provinces. Also, in spite of a lively suffragette movement, women remained disenfranchised. Cf. Brigitta Bader-Zaar : Frauenbewegungen und Frauenrecht. In: Die Habsburgermonarchie 1848–1918 , Band VIII, 2. Teilband . Vienna, 2006, pp. 1005–1027 . But most of all, the reform did not vindicate the hopes held by the government and the Crown that it would provide the basis for a functional national assembly that would relegate national disputes to the back burner. The situation was still dominated by individual interests that were unable to reach further than the interests of their nation, province or party.

{ "title": "From Provincial to National Adherence", "text": "If until the revolutionary year of 1848 nobody had paid any attention to nationality, in Slovenia (Austria) until that time and also later Slovenians were usually referred to as the rural population, while Germans (or Italians) were seen as the urban and town population. In the political sense, the majority population was distinctively provincially oriented. Cities and towns were considered German (or Italian) purely on the basis of linguistic differences with the countryside, as a sign of legal and social distinctiveness. After the restoration of the constitutional life, the nationalist aspirations led to a decisive push in the direction of nationalism, as the bourgeoisie was forced to declare itself nationally. Janez Cvirn : Trdnjavski trikotnik. Politična orientacija Nemcev na Spodnjem Štajerskem ( 1867–1914 ) [The Trdnjava Triangle. Political Orientation of Germans in Lower Styria (1867–1914)]. Maribor, 1997, pp. 9–12, 19–33 . In Carniola the Slovenian situation was the most favourable, Cf. Matić , Nemci v Ljubljani , pp. 11–42 . while in Styria the German and the Slovenian side both started to consolidate their positions. While the ambitions of the Germans were easier to achieve due to the existing German estate situation, Janez Cvirn : Boj za Celje. Politična orientacija celjskega nemštva 1861–1907 [Fighting for Celje. Political Orientation of the Celje Germans 1861–1907]. Ljubljana, 1988, p. 5 . the Slovenians had to start pursuing their goals in much more difficult circumstances. In Carniola a moderate conservative wing, headed by Janez Bleiweiss , was prevalent in the 1860s, while in Styria a liberal political orientation was formed under the agile leadership of Josip Vošnjak . Vasilij Melik : Josip Vošnjak in njegovi spomini [ Josip Vošnjak and His Memoirs]. In: Vasilij Melik (ed.), Josip Vošnjak : Spomini [ Josip Vošnjak : Memoirs]. Ljubljana, 1982, pp. 646–658 . The conservatively oriented Slovenian politics in Carinthia was in a much worse situation due to the unfavourable electoral geometry. Cf. Janko Pleterski : Narodna in politična zavest na Koroškem. Narodna zavest in politična orientacija prebivalstva slovenske Koroške v letih 1848–1914 [National and Political Conscience in Carinthia.

A Collection of Contributions from the Scientific Consultation at the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]. Ljubljana, 1995, p. 87 . In Istria the Slovenian population faced the fact that in order to achieve its national rise it should get rid of the Italian irredentism, constantly present in the Istrian politics since the middle of the 1860s. In the Gorizia region the population structure (except in Gorizia) was more or less clearly determined according to the Italian-Slovenian national key, Cf. Branko Marušič : Pregled politične zgodovine Slovencev na Goriškem 1848–1899 [Overview of the Political History of Slovenians in the Gorizia Region 1848–1899]. Nova Gorica, 2005, pp. 231–236 .

Razprave in članki [Slovenians 1848–1918. Discussions and Articles]. Ljubljana, 2002, p. 217 . therefore the Slovenian politics (like in Carniola) had a more favourable starting point. The situation of the Slovenians I am referring to Hungarian Slovenians in quotes because they did not establish national connections with the Cisleithanian Slovenian territories, where the Slovenian politics had already established certain elements of national awareness. on the other side of the river Mura was increasingly defined by the Hungarian nationalism, while the voting right excluded the majority of the Slovenian population in Hungary from the political life.

Vasilij Melik : Slovenska politika ob začetku dualizma [Slovenian Politics in the Beginning of Dualism]. In: Melik , Slovenci 1848–1918 , pp. 296–297 . However, already by the end of the 1860s the relations within the Slovenian politics intensified in connection with the liberal legislation and the Concordat issues. The division between the Old Slovenians and the Young Slovenians, initiated already by Fran Levstik with the newspaper Naprej (1863), deepened even further. The Slovenian liberal politics culminated in the camps they organised, while the political conflicts also revealed themselves with the establishment of the conservative newspaper Domovina in the Gorizia region (1867) Ibid., p. 311 . and the liberal newspaper Slovenski narod in Maribor (1868). Cf. Janez Cvirn : Slovenska politika na Štajerskem ob koncu 60-ih let 19. stoletja [Slovenian Politics in Styria at the End of the 1860s]. Zgodovinski časopis , 1993, No. 4, p. 523 .

Slovenski narod , 25 August 1870 . The Young Slovenians nevertheless kept surrendering to the pressure of the Old Slovenians and finally accepted the Catholic etiquette, at least outwardly. However, when the Slovenian Catholic camp joined the Hohenwart's club in 1871 and argued for a broad provincial autonomy based on the historical law, Christian principles in the constitutional and educational field and national equality, the Young Slovenians could not accept such a programme.

From the United Slovenia Programme to the International Recognition of the Republic of Slovenia]. Ljubljana, 2005, pp. 29–30 . After the relocation of the Slovenski narod newspaper, Josip Jurčič and Josip Vošnjak to Ljubljana, the strengthened Carniolan liberal side intensified the ideological-political division, which became evident already in September 1872 at the meeting of the Slovenska matica society. The division was also apparent during the intense discussions in the Provincial Assembly and especially when the Slovenec newspaper was founded in 1873. Vasilij Melik : Razcep med staroslovenci in mladoslovenci [Division Between the Old Slovenians and Young Slovenians]. In: Melik , Slovenci 1848–1918 , pp. 470–483 . In the Gorizia region this became noticeable with the emergence of the conservative newspaper Glas in 1872 and the Gorica society a year later (after the split with the Young Slovenians Josip Tonki became its first president). See Marušič , Pregled politične zgodovine Slovencev na Goriškem , pp. 239–277 . The dissolution of unity in Slovenia culminated at the National Assembly elections in 1873 and the Provincial Assembly elections in 1874, when the conservative camp supported the Church-political standpoints while the liberals were interested exclusively in the matters of national politics. Nevertheless, the intensified German (Italian) nationalism consolidated the Slovenian ranks in the middle of this decade, forcing them to return to the unification policy (for example, in the Gorizia region with the formation of the Sloga political society).

The Italians also succeeded to prevail in the completely Slovenian municipality of Pomjan, while the Slovenians had a slightly better representation in Milje.

In 1883 Slovenians yet again gained the majority in the Provincial Assembly of Carniola. Andrej Winkler was appointed as the provincial president. Due to the government's scrappy politics, the liberal camp succumbed to disagreements (the flexible and the radical wing). The Slovenian national party (supporting unity) was, however, also split by the opposition between the liberal and conservative camps. The liberals accepted the Catholic standpoints only outwardly, and unity was constantly challenged. The opposing candidates from the liberal and Catholic ranks stood against the official unification candidates at certain elections. The unification policy started crumbling after Jakob Missia was appointed as the Bishop of Ljubljana. The division of opinion became even more apparent when Anton Mahnič took over the professorship in theology in Gorizia. He achieved the final separation of spirits in 1888 with the Rimski katolik magazine. Cf. Fran Erjavec : Zgodovina katoliškega gibanja na Slovenskem [The History of Catholic Movement in Slovenia]. Ljubljana, 1928, pp. 28–47 . In Carniola the unification leadership was no longer able to present the complete candidacy for the Provincial Assembly elections in 1889. Under the influence of the second Austrian Catholic rally in 1889 and the more radical political Catholicism, the Catholic Political Society Cf. Slovenec , 12 January 1890 . Slovenski narod , 1 February 1890 . was established in Ljubljana in January 1890. Especially after the first Slovenian Catholic rally in Ljubljana in August 1892, this society encouraged the establishment of numerous Catholic political societies in Carniola. The organisation of the Catholic camp forced the liberals to establish the Slovenian Society in February 1891.

However, the appointment of Sisinio de Pretis, who was favourably inclined towards the German liberals, to the position of the Trieste deputy, promptly caused dissatisfaction in the Slovenian ranks. Nevertheless, the Slovenian political line in the Gorizia region was in the best position (apart from Carniola). The common unity in the Gorizia region started to crumble already with newspapers Edinost and Soča, as the former stood for flexibility in politics while the latter (under the leadership of Franc Podgornik ) argued for more radical approaches. Podgornik's successor, Anton Gregorčič , initially (politically) oscillated between Anton Mahnič's zealousness in the middle of the 1880s (when he argued for the thesis that religion preceded nationality) and his own more liberal ideas, which he adopted towards the end of the decade under the influence of the dynamic Andrej Gabršček . Thus he clashed with Tonkli's and Mahnič's circle. In 1890 Gabršček replaced the conservative leader Tonkli as the president of the Sloga society and defeated him at the National Assembly elections in 1891. Nevertheless, unity was not yet threatened and the turmoil on the Slovenian side had ceased. Meanwhile a strenuous fight broke out with the liberal (irredentist) Gorizia Italians and their defence organisations. In the middle of the 1880s an economic boycott was still impossible due to the anti-Slovenian policy of the Gorizia Italians. However, in the beginning of the 1890s the Slovenian political line strengthened enough for the Soča newspaper to state that Slovenians were turning into an important factor in our town. Cf.

In 1883 the government recognised the equal status of Croatian, Slovenian and Italian languages in courts. Despite the weak Slovenian-Croatian representation, the Provincial Assembly of Istria was one of the main battlegrounds of the fight for the right to use Slovenian and Croatian languages in administration and judiciary. This struggle was initiated by Matko Laginja in 1883, when he was the first person to speak Croatian in the Provincial Assembly, provoking a sharp response from the Italian side. Darko Darovec : Kratka zgodovina Istre [Short History of Istria]. Koper, 2009, p. 203 . The Slovenian-Croatian political line had to work under significantly worse conditions due to the fact that no provincial centre had been established in Istria (the Provincial Assembly moved various times) and Istria had only come to life as a united province under the Habsburg dynasty in the constitutional period. Cities were mostly Italian, while the Slovenian population was predominantly rural. Due to the strenuous activities of the Italian municipalities (and defence societies), it was difficult for Slovenian language to assert itself in public in Istria. Janez Kramar : Marezige.

Unlike the Cisleithanian Slovenians (except the Venetian Slovenians), who, during Taaffe's government (and even before), established a certain degree of integrating national elements, the so called Vends from the Prekmurje region could not establish links with the people on the other side of the river Mura due to their political separation, and they also did not establish their own national allegiance. The idea, which the Slovenians on the right bank of Mura had already adopted, first reached the Slovenian priests in the Prekmurje region and only slowly asserted itself among the simple folk. Cf.

After the first Slovenian Catholic rally, the Catholic camp intended to infuse the entire society with Catholic principles. Considering that the peasant population represented the majority of the Slovenian population, the expansion of voting rights set the foundation for the growing election triumphs of the Catholic camp. The Catholic camp also endeavoured to increase its influence among workers in the framework of political and educational societies because it was afraid of the potential spreading of the social democracy, which, in turn, was not able to achieve any important successes even after the establishment of the Yugoslav Social Democratic Party in 1896 due to its small electoral base (especially workers in industrial plants).

The Slovenian side in Carinthia experienced genuine political failure. Pleterski , Narodna in politična zavest , pp. 212–213 . The share of Slovenian voters was also declining in the Velikovci constituency. German dominance was not just a consequence of the economic dependence of the Carinthian Slovenians, but also resulted from the fact that the Slovenian side in Carinthia was unprepared for the expansion of voting rights. In Istria the situation failed to improve due to the Italian pressure. Jože Pirjevec : Socialni in nacionalni problemi v Trstu 1860–1914 [Social and National Problems in Trieste 1860–1914].

Nevertheless, the fight for the right to use both languages continued. National tensions culminated for the first time in 1894, when the Ministry of Justice issued an ordinance on setting up bilingual inscriptions in courts in linguistically mixed areas. The government's intention provided Slovenians and Croats in Istria with additional motivation, while the Italian side strongly criticised it. Openly supported by the Istrian municipalities, the Italian side achieved the withdrawal of the ordinance (the bilingual inscriptions remained only in Piran). Cf.

{ "title": "The Final Schism Between the Nations", "text": "In Gorizia, the relations with the Italians reached at that time a critical point and transformed into actual national struggles. Already in March 1893 Vjekoslav Spinčić warned the National Assembly about the deliberate Italian actions, aimed at forming a protective Italian circle around the town by establishing Italian schools and nurseries through Lega Nazionale. The Italian pressure was felt especially at the National Assembly elections in 1897, when the Slovenian colours were represented only by Anton Gregorčič and Alfred Coronini in the Gorizia region. Cf. Soča , 5 March 1897 . Edinost , 3 March 1897 . The Slovenian political side supported the unification orientation in these matters in the 1890s, but the political polarisation was nevertheless becoming increasingly evident. When Jakob Missia was appointed as the Archbishop of Gorizia in 1897, the pace of the developments hastened. With the aim of dividing the liberal camp, Missia succeeded to disintegrate the unity in Gorizia already in the middle of the following year, when two completely separate political camps were formed. Cf. Henrik Tuma : Iz mojega življenja [From My Life]. Branko Marušič (ed.). Ljubljana, 1997, pp. 242–248 . On the other hand, political pluralisation was also encouraged by the Slovenian economic successes, which also caused the Germans (along with the Italians) in Gorizia to feel increasingly threatened.

At the Carniolan Provincial Assembly elections in 1895 the Catholic camp completely defeated the liberals, who only kept their terms of office in the cities. Cf. Slovenski narod , 9 December 1895 .

After the forceful German reaction to Badeni's ordinances, the Slovenian political side simultaneously discovered that the times of finding allies among the German conservatives in the National Assembly were over. Cf. Slovenski narod , 18 September 1897 . Although both sides supported the demand for national autonomy and signed the agreement on unity in March 1898, it was promptly disregarded as it compromised the alliance between the liberals and the German large estate owners. In such circumstances, the Catholic party supported the idea (originally stemming from the liberal camp) of establishing closer ties with Croats. Cf. Slovenski narod , 7 April 1897 . The liberals, alarmed by the loss of their leading position in establishing connections with Croatian parties, refused the Catholic action (in Trsat). Although the Catholic camp announced the Christian alliance of Austrian nations as its goal, after the Whitsun Programme (1899) it realised that the point of no return had been crossed. The Slovenian-Croatian mutuality and approximation became an everyday political routine. Nevertheless, after the Rijeka Resolution, adopted by almost all Croatian parties in October 1905, the Slovenian political line was left completely on its own.

This also became the official orientation of the Catholic party.

After the merger of the parties of law into a single party, the All-Slovenian People's Party allied with the Croatian Party of Law (because of the fear that Slovenians would be left out of the plans for the solution of the Yugoslav question).

Soča , 14 December 1907 and 15 October 1908 . In Trieste, the Slovenian political line faced the enhanced national attitude of the Italian liberal majority. Despite the Italian pressure, the Christian-social part of the Catholic camp pulled away from the unification political line (gathered around the Edinost society). Due to the Italian pressure, the liberals and clericalists united their efforts at the Trieste municipal elections in 1909 and the National Assembly elections in 1911, although the establishment of the Slovenian People's Party for Trieste and Istria in 1909 and the establishment of the Catholic political society for Croats in 1911 clearly announced the gradual decline of the unification tradition.

The (peasant) population of the Prekmurje region also failed to develop the feeling of national affiliation with Slovenians on the other side of the river Mura, since it was not yet aware of this concept.

{ "title": "Slovenians and Yugoslavia 1918–1941", "text": "Slovenians joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Kingdom of SHS) expecting that in the new state context they would have significantly better prospects of adopting decisions on their basic socio-political, socio-economic as well as cultural-educational matters than in the dissolved Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, i.e. that they would have broad autonomist or federalist rights. Miroslav Stiplovšek : Prizadevanja za avtonomijo Slovenije od ustanovitve jugoslovanske države do kraljeve diktature (1918–1929) [Endeavours for the Slovenian Autonomy Since the Establishment of the Yugoslav State Until the King's Dictatorship (1918–1929)]. Časopis za zgodovino in narodopisje , 1994, No. 1, p. 77 . However, that was not the case. The hopes to achieve an autonomous Slovenian state-legal position within the Yugoslav state were finally buried by the Constitution of 28 June 1921. Since the Constitution was adopted on a Serbian national holiday (28 June, St. Vitus' Day), it became known as the St. Vitus' Day Constitution. In principle it was relatively progressive in comparison with other contemporary constitutions as far as the classic rights and freedoms as well as socio-economic rights were concerned. However, it was extremely non-democratic in relation to the national issues. Majda Strobl , Ivan Kristan and Ciril Ribičič : Ustavno pravo SFR Jugoslavije [Constitutional Law of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. Ljubljana, 1981, pp. 33–34 . The two fundamental characteristics of the St. Vitus’ Day Constitution, decisively marking the political life in the Kingdom of SHS, were the Yugoslav national unitarianism and state centralism. The Constitution deprived Slovenians, Croatians and Serbs (the names of other nations were not even mentioned) of their national individuality and incorporated them as an invented single national (Yugoslav) entity into a strict centralist Yugoslav state context. The already formed Yugoslav national entities, defined by the Constitution simply as tribes of the single (Yugoslav) nation, were therefore formally and legally condemned to national erasure. The national unitarianism of the St. Vitus’ Day Constitution was substantiated by the provisions designed specifically to this end, i.e. that the official language of the Monarchy (...) is Serbo-Croat-Slovene and its citizens were – with the exception of the minorities belonging to other tribes and languages – of Serbo-Croat-Slovene nationality. In addition to these provisions, the national unity principle was also asserted by certain other provisions: the provision that the King and Heir Apparent should declare, in their oath in front of the National Assembly, to protect the unity of the nation; the provision that all schools should provide moral education and develop civic consciousness in the spirit of national unity; the provision on banning the newspapers and press which might incite tribal discord; and the provision that all citizens had the obligation to serve the interests of the national community.

{ "title": "Slovenians and Yugoslavia 1918–1941", "text": "Along with national unitarianism, the St. Vitus' Constitution also enforced state centralism. The Constitution provided for the uniform implementation of the administrative authority throughout the Monarchy, i.e. by the individual administrative-territorial units (the so-called òblasti – the expression was taken from Serbian language), established in accordance with the natural, social and economic criteria and with a maximum of 800,000 inhabitants. The Constitution also stipulated that each administrative unit was headed by a so-called head mayor, appointed by the King and responsible for implementing, through public authorities, the operations of the state administration within the individual administrative units.

{ "title": "Slovenians and Yugoslavia 1918–1941", "text": "The centralist state system, established by the St. Vitus' Day Constitution, was legally completed on 26 April 1922, when Pašić's government declared the decree on dividing the state into administrative units, the law on general administration and the law on the self-governance of administrative units and districts. After the decree on dividing the state into administrative units, the Kingdom of SHS was mechanically divided into 33 administrative units regardless of all national and historical criteria. Two of these units were located in the Slovenian territory: the administrative units of Ljubljana (with its seat in Ljubljana) and Maribor (with its seat in Maribor). The Ljubljana administrative unit included the Yugoslav part of the former Carniola region with Jezersko and the judicial districts of Laško, Brežice and Sevnica of the former Styria region, as well as the Croatian district of Kastav; the Maribor administrative unit comprised the rest of the Yugoslav part of Styria, the former Carinthian district of Prevalje, as well as Prekmurje and Međimurje. Slovenia was thereby administratively divided in two parts, depriving Slovenians of one of their fundamental prospects of a harmonious national development – the unity of their own national territory. This prospect was further limited by the law on general administration, stipulating that the head mayors, proposed by the Minister of the Interior and appointed by the King, were subordinate to the Belgrade government and in fact merely state officials adhering to the decisions of the central administration. Thereby the central administration did not only gain control over the head mayors, but also over the authorities of the constitutionally guaranteed self-governance of the administrative units – i.e. the Administrative Unit Assemblies (their jurisdiction included especially the financial and economic matters of the administrative units). According to the law on general administration, the head mayors as the political representatives of the government also represented this government in the administrative unit self-governances. They had sufficient autonomy to withhold, of their own accord, the execution of any decisions taken by the self-governance authorities and not warranted by the Constitution, legal acts, or administrative unit decrees. The decisions of the head mayors could only be appealed at the state council – i.e. the supreme administrative court whose members were appointed by the King and the National Assembly. The self-governance and self-governing powers of the administrative units, warranted by the St. Vitus' Day Constitution, were therefore subordinate to the decisions of the head mayors and the state council. In view of all these considerations the self-governance of the administrative units by no means undermined the centralist state system codified in the St. Vitus' Day Constitution, because the self-governance authorities of the administrative units were subordinate to the supreme central administration. According to the St. Vitus' Day Constitution, the institute of self-governance of the administrative units was based purely on the technical division of state administration. Thus, according to the iure delegatio principle, the self-governance authorities at the administrative unit level carried out, on behalf of the central state authorities, a part of their tasks, while at the same time they were still subordinate to the central Belgrade administration. The St. Vitus' Day Constitution and the resulting administrative and self-governance arrangement thereby created a comprehensive and impenetrable centralist state system which precluded the artificially formed administrative territorial units from taking independent decisions with regard to public matters.

{ "title": "Slovenians and Yugoslavia 1918–1941", "text": "The national-political and state-legal development in the Yugoslav state was also substantiated in a similar manner after the introduction of the personal dictatorship of King Alexander Karađorđević on 6 January 1929. On that day King Alexander abolished the St.Vitus' Day Constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and disabled the driving force of the democratic parliamentary system – the political parties – by prohibiting and dissolving them. By the end of 1929 he renewed the enactment of the Yugoslav national unitarianism and state centralism. In the Act Amending the Protection of Public Security and Order Act of 6 January 1929 he again defined Slovenians, Croats and Serbs as tribes of the single Yugoslav nation. He went even further in the law on the name and division of the Kingdom, declared on 3 October 1929. The Yugoslav national unitarianism was also enacted with the new state name, as King Alexander changed the name of the Kingdom, previously composed of three tribal names – Serbian, Croatian and Slovenian – into a single Yugoslav name covering all of the national individualities. Thus, as of October 1929, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia came into existence and was newly divided into nine Banates. Consequently the administrative units of Ljubljana and Maribor were merged into the Drava Banate, which encompassed the whole Slovenian territory in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia with the exception of the districts of Črnomelj and Metlika, but with the Croatian district of Čabar. These districts were then exchanged between the Drava Banate and the neighbouring Sava Banate on 28 August 1931, which allowed for the adjustment to ethnic borders. However, the new administrative division into individual Banates – in the Slovenian case adapted to the ethnic borders – never challenged the principle of state centralism. The Banates were administrative-territorial units, directly subordinate to the central state administration in Belgrade regardless of their legally guaranteed general administrative jurisdictions. The Bans, who implemented the highest political and general administrative powers in the Banates, were merely representatives of the King's government. The Bans and all senior officials of the Banate administration were proposed by the Minister of the Interior and appointed by the King, while the members of the Bans' advisory bodies – Bans' Councils – were proposed by the Bans and appointed or replaced by the Minister of the Interior. The Banates therefore never negated centralism, although they represented a specific manner of administrative decentralisation in the Yugoslav unitarian state. Thereby the Banate administration was only one of the steps in the completely one-tier system of the Yugoslav state authorities' strict hierarchic scale. Jurij Perovšek : V zaželjeni deželi.

{ "title": "Slovenians and Yugoslavia 1918–1941", "text": "The question of how to declare one's attitude toward the unitarian centralist Yugoslav national-state reality was decisive for defining the relationship between Slovenians and Yugoslavia, between the nation and the state. Slovenians responded to this question in different ways. There was a division of opinion among them regarding the decision whether to accept the merging with the imaginary Yugoslav nation or resist such a national fate and fight, on the basis of the conscience of the specific Slovenian national individuality, for the right to the Slovenian language, culture and national statehood, which could be ensured by the Yugoslav state union reorganised in the autonomist or federal manner. The majority of the Slovenian nation and politicians opted for the Slovenian autonomist-federalist position, which was shared in the entire Slovenian political space of that time through individual political subjects or public servants. In the 1920s the Slovenian autonomist-federalist position was defended by the autonomist-oriented Slovenian cultural workers; the Catholic Slovenian People's Party; the liberal National Socialist Party (only in the first half of the 1920s); Prepeluh's and Lončar's Slovenian Autonomist Association; Novačan's Agrarian or Slovenian Republican Party; the Alliance of Working People (the electoral alliance between the communists, Christian socialists and the Ljubljana local fraction of the Socialist Party of Yugoslavia, the so-called Zarjani, for the municipal elections in Ljubljana on 3 December 1922); the Socialist Party of Working People; the Slovenian Republican Party of Workers and Peasants; the communists (after 1923); and, since the middle of the 1920s, also the so-called Bernot's Group from the socialist camp and the Slovenian Peasant Party, formed in 1926 by the merger between the former liberal Independent Peasant Party and the Slovenian Republican Party of Workers and Peasants. All these political subjects called for a revision of the St. Vitus' Day Constitution and the formation of the autonomist-federalist system of the Yugoslav state. Ibid., pp. 145–146 .

The most accomplished autonomist-federalist state-legal programmes in terms of contents were written before the elections for the National Assembly of the Kingdom of SHS by the Slovenian Republican Party and the Slovenian People's Party. These two parties were the first to substantiate, in concrete terms, the right to and appeal for the statehood of the Slovenian nation within the Yugoslav state community. Thus the Slovenian Republican Party, claiming that the Slovenian nation was sufficiently mature to manage itself and breathe with its own lungs, demanded absolute national sovereignty and statehood for Slovenians according to the examples of Switzerland and the United States of America. It insisted on the transformation of the Kingdom of SHS into a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which would not only include Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia but Bulgaria as well. In the beginning of February 1923 this party presented a detailed explication of its state-legal programme and pointed out that Slovenia would be an independent state within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with its own National Assembly and state administration, connected to the other federal units only as an equal state component of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would be a state composed of separate units, where only the following elements would be common: the army (whereby Slovenians would serve the military in Slovenia), Ministry of Foreign Affairs (with a certain number of Slovenian and Croatian members according to a commonly agreed formula), finances (they would be common only in the common matters), currency (it would only have a common design, while the banknotes would only have either Slovenian, Croatian, Serbian or Bulgarian inscriptions), trade agreements with foreign countries, customs and tariffs, and the President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. For one mandate of three or four years, the President would be Slovenian, for the next he would be Croatian, then Serbian, and then Bulgarian.

They shared their view with other unitarian and centralist political forces in Slovenia: that the creation of the Yugoslav state had brought about a decisive period of establishing a single Yugoslav nation, which supposedly represented the natural and historically substantiated end of the previously separate development of the individual South Slavic ethnicities. Their integration into a new, higher and politically stronger Yugoslav national community would thus represent a reason, in the national and state sense, for their existence in the centralist Yugoslavia, as only such a state would be able to settle all the national, cultural, economic and state-legal differences between them; while their transformation and elevation into a Yugoslav state nation would grant them true historical freedom and give sense to their national emancipation efforts.

The Yugoslav Democratic Party (JDS) or the Independent Democratic Party (SDS) rigorously defended this conviction, as pointed out by the leading Slovenian liberal politician of the 1920s, Dr. Gregor Žerjav , in February 1924: To transform the Slovenian part of the nation into Yugoslavism, to continue to build upon the achievements of our cultural and economic efforts in order to assure the greatest possible unification, to realise the Slovenian organisational potentials in all parts of the nation so as to grow into an indivisible Yugoslav entity, to bring together all of the creative forces among Slovenians in this action: that is the wish of the Slovenian democracy. In this way the problem of Slovenians as a small nation would be solved in a favourable manner. (underlined by J. P.). Jutro , 5. February 1924, Jugoslovenska demokracija na pohodu: veličasten zbor zaupnikov JDS v Ljubljani . The second fundamental thought which led the Slovenian liberals in their devotion to the Yugoslav unitarianism and centralism, stemmed from the opposition to the strongest Slovenian political party – the SLS. Its autonomist orientation was seen by the Slovenian liberals only as an effort to surrender the whole of Slovenia into the hands of clericalism . Jutro , 20. November 1923, editorial of 19 November . That would imply the establishment of an episcopal government in the autonomous Slovenia, which would turn into a papal province. Gregor Žerjav : Naglavni greh klerikalne stranke. Domovina , 25. March 1926 . Jutro , 14. August 1925, editorial of 13 August . According to the unitarian liberal assessment such a development would have critical consequences. In this context the liberals revealed their ideological message of what kind of circumstances would arise should Slovenia become some sort of an autonomous country as desired by the Slovenian People's Party. Its terror would sustain the clerical supremacy in Slovenia for many decades, as it was written in 1926 in the leading liberal newspaper Jutro, the lower and higher administrative authorities, public safety, everything would be under the control of the bishops and political clergy, and no countermeasures whatsoever could be taken against their actions (...).

Perovšek , V zaželjeni deželi , pp. 166–167 . Slovenian political liberalism expressed its adherence to the Yugoslav national integralism most emphatically in the middle of the 1930s, when the leading JNS politicians from the Drava, Sava and Primorska Banates (Slovenia and Croatia with Dalmatia and Herzegovina) drew up the so-called Pohorje Declaration on 19 and 20 August 1935 under the leadership of the Slovenian liberal leader Dr. Albert Kramer . In this Declaration the liberals presented their outlook on the national issue yet again. According to them, Serbs, Croats and Slovenians were a single nation, in the ethnic sense , while the Yugoslav national unity was a sense of the internal connection between Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, resulting from these people's destiny, and the conviction that all of us form a community, no parts of which could live freely and independently . Therefore the nationalities, (...) the independent parts of the nation, can only develop their individual cultural characteristics and preserve their traditions in unity, in connection with the traditions of the national whole. Yugoslavs as a nation , the Pohorje Declaration stated, can only develop in a unitarian state .

Also in the 1930s the liberal politics argued in favour of the Yugoslav state centralism. This became most apparent in January 1933, when it opposed the so-called Ljubljana Declaration – a federal state-legal programme, outlined by the former Slovenian People's Party on 31 December 1932 – extremely resolutely. The Ljubljana Declaration, which called for the establishment of a Slovenian federal unit (apart from the Serbian and Croatian units) in the Yugoslav state and demanded the recognition of the Slovenian national individuality, name, flag, financial independence as well as political and cultural freedom, Narodna in univerzitetna knjižnica, Rokopisni oddelek, 312, 1–9, 1933 . represented, in the eyes of the liberal politics, an insane demand, a national sin and criminal act.

Ibid . Of course, the administrative decentralisation defined in such a manner remained within the framework of the unitarian state. This was also confirmed by the actions of the liberal politics in the context of the Ban's Council of the Drava Banate, which, in the first half of the 1930s, consisted of the liberals. The liberal Ban's Councillors may have demanded the broadening of the Ban's Council jurisdiction when it came to drawing up the budget. However, their demands, in view of the fundamental liberal centralist orientation, never radicalised into demands for the establishment of a Slovenian Banate with considerable autonomist legislative, executive and financial powers.

The celebration of Korošec' s birthday did not only take place in Ljubljana, but all over Slovenia. Bonfires burned, and men wore green ties as a sign of their adherence to the SLS and its leader, Korošec . The so-called Green Tie Movement developed in the Domžale region.

After the green ties were forbidden, the movement's supporters wore green socks. The protests culminated in the so-called Šenčur Events on 22 May 1932, when the SLS prepared anti-regime protests in Šenčur during the gathering of the JRKD. Gendarmerie intervened and fired shots in the air. This was followed by extensive demonstrations against the regime all around Slovenia. At this time the SLS also sought the support of the Church. The celebrations of Korošec's birthday turned into eucharistic parish gatherings. Since the gendarmerie was forbidden from entering the churches, Korošec's supporters could gather there and safely celebrate him and the political goals he personified. The political epilogue of the celebration of Korošec's sixtieth birthday took place at the Court for the Protection of the State in Belgrade: in February 1933 eleven defendants were sentenced to several months in prison due to their anti-regime declarations and exclamations during the JRKD gathering in Šenčur or at Korošec's birthday celebrations.

The federalist demands of the SLS, or the aforementioned Ljubljana Declaration, also referred to as Korošec's Declaration or Slovenian Declaration, were even more resounding. The regime responded resolutely and ordered the confinement of the members of the highest SLS leadership, including Anton Korošec . After its leaders were confined (they were allowed to go free after the death of King Alexander in October 1934) and until the change of the regime in June 1935 the SLS no longer emphasised the federalist demands, but it did not forget them. This especially proved to be true in the second half of the 1930s, when the former Slovenian People's Party – as a part of the ruling Yugoslav Radical Association, another all‑Yugoslav political party which existed in the 1930s – once again, though gradually, started making demands for the national assertion of Slovenians and autonomist reorganisation of the state. Apart from the SLS, various political groups, movements and associations made demands for the Slovenian national emancipation at that time as well. The issue was emphasised by the peasant and workers' movement (in their gazettes Slovenska zemlja, Ljudska pravica, Delavska politika, Delavski obzornik, Neodvisnost, and Edinost), the socially-progressive movement gathered around the Slovenska beseda gazette, and the Catholic-corporatist oriented groups gathered around the gazettes Straža v viharju and Mi mladi borci. The same demands were also strongly supported by the People's Front movement. Its protagonists – the communists, Slovenian-oriented national democratic intelligentsia, Christian socialist and the transformed national democratic Slovenian Sokol organisation – were brought together by the self-confident emphasising of the Slovenian national autonomy as well as the clear and resolute demand for the Slovenian national self-determination and autonomist-federal transformation of the Yugoslav state. The equality of Slovenians and their self-governance – meaning such a Yugoslav state as to ensure the existence, unobstructed development and free self-expression of the Slovenian nation in all the areas of its linguistic, cultural, national, economic and political life – was also argued for by the national democratic groups that had distanced themselves from the policies of the liberals due to their support of the undemocratic regime and Yugoslav unitarianism. The majority of these groups were established in the middle of the 1930s (the Slovenian supporters of Maček , the Association of Peasant Boys and Girls Societies, the democratically transformed Slovenian Sokoli organisation). Meanwhile, the first groups to break away from the Slovenian liberal unitarian policy between 1932 and 1933 were, apart from Josip Vidmar with his work Kulturni problem slovenstva (Cultural Problem of Slovenian Identity), the cultural and scientific workers of the liberal-national orientation, gathered around the Sodobnost magazine. At the same time the Slovenian national standpoint was also supported by the group gathered around the Slovenija gazette. Thus an authentic Slovenian national orientation, which continued the Slovenian liberal autonomism from the 1920s, also existed within the liberal camp in the 1930s. It was based on the ideas of the most prominent Slovenian liberal minds of the time: Ivan Prijatelj , Josip Vidmar , and Lojze Ude . Perovšek , V zaželjeni deželi , pp. 171–172 . Even though the autonomist-federalist orientation was supported by the majority of the Slovenian politics and many interesting and detailed state-legal plans of how the Slovenian autonomy was to be substantiated were drawn up in its context, the question of its realisation only began to define the actual dimensions of the Slovenian autonomism. Only some of the contemporaneous Slovenian autonomist ambitions were realised in the First Yugoslavia. The first goals were reached in the time of the aforementioned administrative unit self-governances between 1927 and 1929, when the strongest Slovenian political party – Slovenian People's Party – established a sort of a silent autonomy in Slovenia. As it was, on 23 January 1927 the elections for the Administrative Unit Assemblies took place, and the SLS received the majority of votes on the basis of its autonomist programme in the Ljubljana and Maribor administrative units. During the constitution of the Administrative Unit Assemblies a month later, its deputies elected the representatives of the SLS as the Presidents of the Ljubljana and Maribor Administrative Assemblies and their executive bodies – the Administrative Unit Committees. Furthermore, both head mayors of the Ljubljana and Maribor administrative units, appointed on 28 February 1927, belonged to the ranks of the SLS as well. Because the SLS judged it could take advantage of the existing political circumstances and at least partly implement its autonomist ideas through the administrative self-governance, simultaneously ensuring its authority and domination in Slovenia, it entered the government in February 1927. Thus it opted for pragmatism after long years of being on the side of the opposition.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36287/ch03.html#p-80" },
{ "title": "Slovenians and Yugoslavia 1918–1941", "text": "The introduction of administrative unit self-governances meant a partial alleviation of the strict centralist state-legal system implemented by the St. Vitus' Day Constitution. Thus we can also refer to the period when this took place – from the formal establishment on 23 February 1927 until the introduction of the King's dictatorship on 6 January 1929, when the Administrative Unit Assemblies were abolished – as the time when Slovenian parliamentarism came to life in the First Yugoslavia. This period was characterised by the intense endeavours of the SLS to ensure – through the administrative unit self‑governances and under its leadership – as much independence in the management of the important socio-economic and cultural-educational affairs as possible, because the centralist state administration had been either addressing these issues inappropriately or neglecting them for many years. In the first half of 1927 both Slovenian administrative unit self-governances took over a variety of jurisdictions from the Ljubljana and Maribor head mayors in accordance with the provisions of the St. Vitus' Day Constitution and the subsequent government Decree on the Administrative Unit and District Self-Governance: the control of municipalities and local self-governances, as well as the management of the former provincial assets. Later these administrative units also organised their own financial institutions. In the time when the SLS was still in the government – until the middle of April 1927 – the Belgrade National Assembly also gave the Slovenian Administrative Unit Assemblies the right to amend, supplement and abolish the former provincial laws in line with the constitution and state legislation. Thus the Slovenian Administrative Unit Assemblies also had a broader legislative jurisdiction. A year later, in March 1928, both Slovenian administrative unit self-governances were the only administrative units in the state to also receive – according to a special authorisation from the National Assembly – the right to change certain important decrees of the National Government of SHS in Ljubljana as well as those of the Provincial Government for Slovenia from 1918–1921. Thus they had the right to adopt not only the executive decrees accompanying the laws passed in the National Assembly, but also legally binding regulations – de facto they even started to carry out limited legislative functions. This privilege resulted from the participation of the SLS in the government. The asymmetric implementation of the administrative unit self-governance in Slovenia gave rise to criticism, especially in Croatia, where they referred to the Slovenian administrative units as a state within the state.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36287/ch03.html#p-81" },

The SLS remained in the government until the onset of the King's dictatorship. In comparison with other self-governances in the state, in the second half of 1927 the Ljubljana and Maribor administrative unit self-governances took over – from the individual line ministries – the greatest share of matters and institutions in the field of public construction, agriculture, non-agrarian industries, health, social welfare and vocational education. Furthermore, their administrative unit budgets for the years 1928 and 1929, which ensured the financial foundations for their operation and were the largest in the state, were confirmed by the Minister of Finance swiftly and without any complications. In this context the centralist authorities managed to attain their goal: to relieve the central budget of the obligations to finance the individual administrative units. Namely, those self-governances that wanted to carry out their tasks successfully – of these the Slovenian self-governances were especially prominent – had to rely mostly on their own resources for the preparation of their budgets.

The main task of the Ban's Council was to comment on the Ban's budget proposal with regard to the economic, social, health and cultural-educational activities and institutions from the viewpoint of the needs of the districts and cities represented by the Ban's Council as well as, more generally, for the territory of the whole Banate. However, it could not adopt any decisions on the budget.

Prispevki za novejšo zgodovino , 1997, No. 2, pp. 102–103 . Later the discussions about the budget developed from the focused local framework into thorough debates about all the outstanding economic, financial, social, health, educational and cultural issues and the activities of the public administration. Occasionally they also touched upon political issues and reflected all of the current affairs in Slovenia. Such functioning of the Ban's Council was encouraged by the SLS after it had entered the government in the summer of 1935. The SLS leader Anton Korošec , who became the Minister of the Interior, used his function to ensure that the leading positions in the authorities of the Drava Banate and the majority of those in the Ban's Council were taken over by the members of his party. With the domination of the SLS adherents in the Ban's Council – who, like in the first half of the 1930s when the Ban's Administration was in the hands of the liberals, exploited their administrative privileges to secure party benefits – the specific circumstances from the time when administrative unit self-governance had been in force were restored. The Ban's Council became an increasingly important factor in solving the issues relevant to the socio-economic and cultural-educational progress of Slovenia. A new era in the efforts for an autonomous Slovenia began. The demands for the Slovenian economic, financial, social and cultural independence as well as equality of the Slovenian language in the official affairs became more numerous, and the name Slovenia increasingly often replaced the designation Drava Banate in the Ban's Council discussions. These demands were made by the Ban's Councillors at each session. The autonomist endeavours of the Ban's Council reached their peak on 17 February 1940, when it adopted the resolution on the establishment of a separate state-legal unit, the Banate of Slovenia. At this point the Ban's Councillors also underlined that the Ban's Council should be immediately replaced with an elected Banate Assembly, which would, among other things, be responsible for all the aspects of the Banate budget as well as enjoy legislative competence. The resolution on the establishment of the Banate of Slovenia reflected the existing state of affairs in Slovenia, where during the second half of the 1930s life in fact proceeded independently and according to the will of Slovenians, even in the absence of the formal legal basis for this.

When the Banate of Croatia was established, the Yugoslav state leadership also provided for the possibility of the formation of other state-legal units (Banates) in the country. A special commission responsible for drawing up the legal acts for the establishment of the Banate of Slovenia was appointed with the government on 14 September 1939. On this basis the Ban's Administration of the Drava Banate prepared the texts of all sorts of decrees: about the establishment of the Slovenian Banate; organisation of Ban's Administration and Banate Assembly as the Slovenian parliamentary representation; elections for the Banate Assembly and its rules of procedure; administrative court for Slovenia; and about the Banate budget.

On Friday, 14 January 1921, a veritable spring sun was shining upon the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade, despite the winter season.

On that Friday, buildings had been decked out with flags since the morning, and the old royal palace and the streets were lined with soldiers, with curious and festive masses gathering behind them. Many people wanted to see what was about to happen with their own eyes, many wanted to be there, to participate in a political event reaching beyond the everyday understanding of politics. For what was announced for the 14 January was no party-related political curiosity but rather something that would be, or was at least supposed to be, of extreme importance for the country and its citizens.

Speakers had to take turns in the sequence of standpoints for – against – for – against etc., and had to limit the duration of their speeches (to a rather generous one hour and a half for parliamentary group leaders and one hour for other representatives during the discussion of principles, and to an hour for group leaders and 30 minutes for representatives in the special debate), but most of all they had to be careful to strictly stick to the topic of the agenda item under discussion. They had to memorize the text and then speak. The Rules of Procedure also explicitly specified that a discussion of anybody's private matters was off limits. Ilija A.

Pržić , Poslovnik sa objašnjenjima , § 66 . Debates on the budgetary exposés of the ministers were often reminiscent of interpellations as opposition representatives pointed out problems in individual sectors, documented errors, identified corruption etc., naturally blaming everything on the politically responsible minister or even the whole government. Representatives always took their time to debate, usually all of the time provided for by the Rules of Procedure, i.e. two months. The budgets, although frequently unrealized and planned for a utopian economic situation, were also among the most important political documents regularly adopted by the Assembly.

{ "title": "The Budget in Earnest and in Jest", "text": "The budget was always accompanied by what was called the financial act. This was a sort of a collection of figures and various ministerial decisions, government decrees and other instruments that needed to be covered by the budget. From 1922 onward, i.e. from the first budgetary debate after the adoption of the constitution, the financial act was known by a humorous moniker – it was called the omnibus. The term was used to convey that the financial act was jumped on by numerous individuals who added their own interests to the needs of the country. The financial act was so chaotic that it was frequently unclear even to the ministers, who were thus unable to answer specific questions posed to them in the parliament. The true masters of the financial act were senior officials, heads of various public and private offices etc. For a little counter favour, they were able to include (almost) anything into the financial act. It is true, however, that some cases of absurd protectionism were often exposed, usually those that involved ministers or representatives. A well-known representative of the Serbian National Radical Party Stevan Janković was able to sneak in an interpretation according to which the high school of forestry in the French city of Nancy, finished by Janković's son Đura Janković during World War I, was equivalent to the Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry in Belgrade. Ivan Ribar : Politički zapisi . Belgrade, 1948, pp. 48–49 . Đura was thus able to become a senior state official and doors were open for him to enter politics. He was a representative, even a minister in the government led by Milan Stojadinović in 1935; initially a minister without portfolio was later responsible for forests and ores. In the 1930s, he successfully advanced his career, becoming chief of propaganda, Todor Stojkov : Vlada Milana Stojadinovića (1935–1937) .

According to Assembly President Ivan Ribar , Minister Žarko Miladinović had been very serious in preparing his exposé. His presentation was supposed to take two hours. However, the previous items of the budget had drained the representatives, they were exhausted and had had enough of debates. On a Saturday evening, they just wanted to go home. But the item could not be postponed as the budget was overdue. Stjepan Barić , a Croatian representative of the opposition thus rose to speak. Speaking on behalf of the opposition, Barić noted that the post and the telephone and telegraph services were in such total disarray that it was better not to speak about them or else the discussion would have lasted for weeks. In protest against the state supported by the Minister, the opposition said it was leaving the session.

Words deriving from the root to lie were particularly popular, i.e. you're lying, liar, you lie, as were also the words bandit and criminal.

Some statements were openly threatening, such as I'll spill your guts out, you old bitch, some were jokingly insulting, such as A man who's a few screws short of a hardware store shouldn't speak! and You're one of the worst and laziest members of the parliament!, while some bordering the grotesque, such as one representative's scoff against another: You used to be a cook!

Barely a session went by without the chairman ringing his bell and yelling Order! while pandemonium raged at the benches. The tireless and precise assembly stenographers, the wakeful scribes of everything that was said, industriously noted every verbal and vocal interruption from the background as long as they were able to make anything out of the yelling. Past that point they would usually put down words like ranting or noise, and sometimes commotion or great ranting and tumult. Nothing could be understood at that point as everybody was yelling over each other and the chairman was forced to suspend the session, which was usually for ten minutes.

This was enough for heads to cool down so that the representatives were able to start working again until the next interruption. The commotion was sometimes not even (directly) caused by the speaker, as one would naturally expect to occur in the parliament, but rather broke out spontaneously on the back benches.

The commotion was incited by a controversial report submitted by the committee that reviewed the proposed new municipalities act. The protracted document thoroughly dissected the totally new conceptions of the role and significance of municipalities: the composition of municipal boards, responsibilities, conditions for their creation, land consolidation – as well as suffrage. According to the proposal, voting at the municipal elections would be open to all residents on the electoral roll, as said by Miloslav Stojadinović , which was an ordinary statement, but with a charged continuation. Stojadinović went on to add: Gentlemen, the general tendency within the committee seemed to be that women should receive the right to vote as well. Calls of By God! immediately resounded and intensified into a torrent of yelling, comments etc. The chairman had to admonish the representatives not to disturb the speaker. Stojadinović then calmly and eagerly explained the idea: I know that discussions of this type tend to provoke both dispositions and indispositions. Such is the very nature of the matter. He reminded his colleagues that women's suffrage would be constitutional as the imposed constitution provided that women's suffrage would be determined by a separate act, and pointed out that many cultural and national aspects spoke in its favour. Stojadinović talked about equality, mentioned some possible compromise solutions (to enfranchise only a limited number of women in independent professions), but all he got in return were verbal interruptions and noise. Representative Dragović interrupted to yell: Women have more courage than people! and mirthful laughter resounded in the hall. SBNSKJ , 26. redovna sednica, 16 February 1933, pp. 103–120 .

They were even joined by Anton Korošec , the most influential Slovenian politician in the country and a man who rarely put things in writing. Korošec's thoughts are particularly interesting as they were not the result of theoretical speculation but rather of thoroughly practical experience at the highest levels of politics. The slogan is: for the nation, he wrote, but everybody works to fill their own pockets, to fulfil their own ambitions, they work for their personal or at least the benefit of their respectful parties.

According to Korošec , the problem was causing people to become increasingly apathetic. Furthermore, the parliament was hardly dealing with legislation at that point. The main function of the representatives is no longer to legislate and control the administration but rather to intervene and write endless letters in response to requests for interventions. Nowadays, a conscientious representative will waste his day intervening at various ministries and, without exaggeration, he would need a dedicated secretary for all his correspondence.

They emphasised that socialism could not be implemented in the context of the bourgeois democracy and parliamentary institutions, but rather only by means of workers' councils, because only the Soviet authority could protect the true proletarian democracy and the leading role of the industrial proletariat, to which the role of the ruling class belonged. Nevertheless, until the final assumption of power the communists intended to take advantage of the political rights in the bourgeois state, while emphasising that the KPJ was a fundamental opponent of parliamentarism as a means of class government and that after the proletarian takeover of power parliamentarism would no longer be possible.

On the other hand, the social democratic understanding of socialism did not reject the modern social institutions and achievements like parliamentarism and multi-party system, human rights and freedoms, market economy, rule of law, etc. Social democrats saw all of these suppositions of the modern society as indispensable in their perceptions of a socially just state.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36289/ch05.html#p-128" },

The original political thought with regard to the issue of democracy was, in the context of the JSDS, developed by Prepeluh . Already in his early essays he emphasised that democracy had two fundamental dimensions, i.e. the social and national dimension. These two ideas were the essential elements of his opinions with regard to politics and society in general, and they are most closely interconnected. Milan Zver : Demokracija v klasični slovenski politični misli [Democracy in the Classic Slovenian Political Thought]. Ljubljana, 2002, pp. 104–106 . In Prepeluh's perception of democracy the ethical dimension was in the forefront as well, as he kept emphasising that democracy was not only a material law, but especially a cultural emotion, a moral postulate in the spiritual life of the modern man. /…/ Therefore democratic sentiments are far more important than merely materially-envisioned socialist doctrines.

{ "title": "Questions of OF Democracy and Coexistence in the Opinion of Slovenian Marxists 1918–1941", "text": "In 1920, in one of his most important essays Demokracija ali diktatura (Democracy or Dictatorship) , Prepeluh described the theoretical framework of his understanding of democracy and the related democratic nature of the state. In his analyses he established empirically that every class, once it attains the political power, uses democracy for its own advantage, furthering its social agenda. Thus every democratic rule has its social contents. However, in democratic politics, in which all of the social strata participate, these contents are confirmed at democratic elections, where the majority decides. Therefore the nature of democracy may be bourgeois democratic, peasant democratic, or proletarian (socialist) democratic. We cannot only speak about democracy in the presence of harmony between the social and administrative or state power. Democratic states should rely exclusively on the existing social forces, and any violent redistribution of the state power, for example by means of the military, is unacceptable. If conflicts in the relationship between the state and society are obvious, we can only talk about a dictatorship. Prepeluh emphasised that Marxist socialism had always sought the support of democracy, that it wanted to take over the power only democratically, which is why the socialist parties endeavoured for universal suffrage and ascribed such a profound importance to the elections for the legislative and administrative corporations. He talked about the dictatorship of democracy, which was what the socialist parties aspired to, but which was also substantially different from the Bolshevik dictatorship, which may well call itself the dictatorship of the proletariat, but that does not make it true. He described the Russian system at the time as despotic socialism, supported by a strong army but lacking the economic preconditions, which is why Russia had succumbed to a profound material poverty.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36289/ch05.html#p-130" },

She endeavoured persistently to ensure that women attained the status of full citizens in the culturally very diverse Yugoslavia. She understood the women's movement as a part of the general social question and saw it as a form of political, social and cultural work in order to achieve the ideals of socialism and humanism. Suzana Tratnik : Alojzija Štebi . In: Pozabljena polovica [The forgotten Half]. Ljubljana, 2007, pp. 194, 195 . At the end of the war she published a booklet Demokratizem in ženstvo (Democracy and Women) , outlining the women's movement programme. She believed that the times were too serious to keep leaving women on the side-lines, and that they had to be stirred awake from apathy and encouraged to assert their political equality as one of the demands of the democratic age. In her opinion it was also necessary to overcome the belief that the merit of such demands, expressed by women, was very problematic. However, she saw women in the political arena differently from men. According to Alojzija Štebi , women should focus on the field of activities that corresponded most to their most natural calling – motherhood. In the time after the war women should especially become active in social matters, where they should replace the humiliating charity practices. Because of their maternal instincts they would, supposedly, successfully carry out a variety of tasks in the establishment of public life, participate in the state and municipal legislation and administration, all of this with the goal of strengthening the morality and enriching the life of the whole community. Štebi also believed that with their civil rights women would be able to remove the principle of force from the relationship between the nations, as this was supposedly still a heritage from the barbaric past. With this deepened insight into motherhood in its individual and social implications, the democratic society would supposedly ensure that its offspring would be able to apply the right to freedom properly and would not shirk the duties involved in this freedom.

With his deliberations, Etbin Kristan was especially prominent among the Slovenian socialist leaders and deputies. Etbin Kristan , writer, editor, publicist, a leading personality of the social democratic movement in Slovenia before World War I. Elected into the Constitutional Assembly in November 1920; moved to the United States as Commissioner for Emigration in 1921 and stayed there. We should underline his extensive discussion in the committee for the preparation of the constitution in February 1921, when the socialist parliamentary group presented its plan of the constitution as an alternative to the government proposal. On this occasion Kristan emphasised that the socialist parliamentary group had not prepared a so-called socialist constitution, because in view of the political division of power such a constitution would not have had any chance of being adopted. Therefore the constitutional plan allegedly only included the proposals which were more widely acceptable for all the groups aware of the social questions, which had to be addressed systematically, not by means of charity.

He expressed his personal opinion that a new social order would sooner or later follow the existing capitalist system, but that the socialists took into account the realistic circumstances in which they did not have the majority for the implementation of their ideas, while they refused to support violent implementation. He emphasised that the working class would be victorious only when it was numerous enough and thus in the majority, which could only be achieved if tolerance prevailed within the working class itself. The latter was, obviously, aimed against the communists and commented on the differences in the methods of activities, which had divided the working class.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36289/ch05.html#p-132" },

This was disputed intensely by the communist deputies, as such a plan was, in their opinion, in the interest of the bourgeoisie. Ibid., pp. 141–142 . The socialist constitutional plan was based on the standpoint that the authority stemmed from the people, which implied a republican form of government in which the bourgeois parties would participate as well, therefore this would not yet be a socialist government. As far as the monarchy was concerned, the socialists opposed it in principle, not in order to oppose the concrete Karađorđević dynasty. Kristan emphasised that only a republican form of government could represent the foundations for the government in any democratic state in the 20 th century, and that the state had to be sovereign in all its aspects. According to the socialists a state was not sovereign if it had to, for example, share the power with an organisation which was not of this world, that is, with the Church; especially if multiple religions existed in the said state. They argued for the separation of the state from all the churches and supported the freedom of religion and conviction. The separation should also include schools, because it could not be in the interest of the state to bring up Orthodox, Catholic or Muslim citizens, and so on. Instead it should be interested in educating free citizens, while tolerating all religions. They also rejected any participation of the churches in the political, economic and social field.

In their opinion, the efforts should proceed in the direction of reducing the class discord by gradually ensuring equal rights in the economic and social field, namely, organising the society in such a manner that the interests of the people should always come first. Kristan stressed that political democracy was most closely connected with the democracy in the economic field, argued for various forms of property, and ensured that private property would by no means be threatened in the socialist system.

However, it could only play such a role if a suitable electoral system, encompassing the widest strata of the people regardless of gender, was implemented. They rejected the argument that women should not have the right to vote, because in case of their participation in the election the results would be more reactionary than they would otherwise be, because women would supposedly only vote for priests.

For this reason the government adopted certain measures in order to prevent the political activities of the communists. With the Obznana (Announcement), published on 30 December 1920, the government prohibited any communist activities (with the exception of the communist deputies) during the session of the Constitutional Assembly and until the adoption of the Constitution in the effort to prevent general unrest, Bolshevism and bloody revolution, as this decree stated it.

It has to be noted that despite the prohibition the communists still took part in the municipal elections in the spring of 1921, and the authorities did not cause any drastic problems for them. During the pre-election campaign the communist programme was often promoted with disguised language; the urgency of the struggle for the final and ultimate victory of the proletariat was emphasised; claims were made that neither in the Parliament nor in the municipalities could the working and peasant people look for their solutions; it was openly stated that the communists only took part in the municipal elections in order to make sure that the proletariat could stir up a class struggle there as well and thus weaken and dissolve these instruments of slavery.

The move towards the new orientation was reflected in the abandonment of the directive on the formation of illegal Party trade unions; discarding of the unappeasable attitude towards the social democratic workers (but not their leaders) or the establishment of a united front tactics with the workers regardless of their political adherence; and in the search for an alliance with the peasants and the middle-class bourgeoisie with the assistance of the Slovenian National Revolutionaries organisation. The communists wanted to overcome their social isolation with the public declarations with regard to the boycott of the 1933 municipal elections, participation in the workers chamber elections and at the elections of the trade union organisers, as well as by organising the strike movement in the middle of the 1930s.

In the context of the People's Front movement in the second half of the 1930s the communists demanded the democratisation of the political system and improvement of the socio-economic position of workers, small peasants and other weaker strata, while they addressed the widest public by emphasising anti-fascism and thus also attracting a part of the intelligentsia. With such political reorientation and with the appeals to democracy, simultaneously exhibiting the zeal so characteristic for the communists and taking advantage of various legal and semi-legal methods of operation, the KPJ started making its way into the public political life more prominently.

Such a standpoint regarding the federal national programme had already asserted itself in the KPJ as early as in 1923. Jurij Perovšek et al. (eds.): Razprava o nacionalnem vprašanju v KPJ leta 1923.

Thus the Party tried to persuade especially the peasants as the allies of the revolution. It rejected the opinion that as an internationalist workers' party it was not concerned with the resolution of the national question. Instead it started to see this issue as an important mobilisation and tactical resource. Edvard Kardelj : Zbrana dela. Prva knjiga [Collected Works. Book One]. Ljubljana, 1989, pp. 289–313 . Perovšek , Samoodločba in federacija , pp. 39–108 . At the same time as the Slovenian communists, the Central Committee of the KPJ in Vienna and in the Comintern circles in Moscow addressed the Slovenian national question as well. This resulted in the statement of the Communist Parties of Yugoslavia, Italy and Austria in April 1934 on the right of the Slovenian nation to self-determination, including the right to secede from the imperial countries and the right to its unification. The importance of taking the national question into account in order to ensure a successful organisation of the revolutionary struggle of the communists was also reflected in the decision of the Comintern that the Communist Parties of Slovenia and Croatia should be established in the context of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. The goal of this reorganisation was to ensure a more effective political participation of the oppressed nations' communist parties as national parties in the sense of a counterbalance to other national parties. In this regard it was also explicitly underlined that the internal organisational structure of the united KPJ would not change in any sense, and that it would still be based on its centralist foundations. The decision on the establishment of the Communist Party of Slovenia (KPS) was then adopted at the fourth state conference of the KPJ in December 1934, but it was not implemented until more than two years later.

The programme, formed in the shape of a manifesto, was a reflection of the People's Front policy of the communist movement and the growing fascist danger. It addressed the existential endangerment of the Slovenian nation due to the conquest aspirations of Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany, and criticised the ruling Stojadinović Milan Stojadinović , Serbian politician and economist, member of the National Radical Party; President of the Government of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia between 1935 and 1939; President of the Yugoslav Radical Association. – Korošec Anton Korošec , most important Slovenian politician in the First Yugoslavia.

The programme stated that the policy of the former Slovenian People's Party (SLS), headed by Korošec , worked against the interests of the Slovenian nation and characterised it as a policy of being the decisive factor in the opposition between the Serbian and Croatian parties and thus undermining the unity of the oppressed Yugoslav nations in their struggle against the Greater Serbian domination, centralism and terror, while exposing the Slovenian nation to the danger of being left completely alone in its struggle for the national survival. It demanded the introduction of democratic freedoms, abolishment of the January 6 th regime, termination of the economic exploitation of the Slovenian nation by the Greater Serbian centralism, as well as the convening of a democratically-elected Constitutional Assembly and Slovenian Parliament as a representative of the sovereignty of the Slovenian nation. It also called for a united and free Slovenia in a community of equal Yugoslav nations in the context of a federal state. The scope of the People's Front orientation is emphasised especially in the demand for the crucial unification of all democratic political powers that care about the fate of the Slovenian nation, and in this regard the communists guaranteed that democracy and freedom of world view would be respected.

At that time the Comintern abandoned the anti-fascist People's Front orientation and demanded that the Communist Parties operate in the spirit of the pact. This demand was also accepted by the KPJ or KPS, which is why it stopped cooperating with its People's Front allies. The disputes between the communist and social democratic movement renewed and even intensified with the increasingly imperialist policy of the Soviet Union. The communists characterised the war as imperialist. Supposedly it was caused by the British and French imperialists and the treacherous Second International. Zgodovina Zveze komunistov Jugoslavije , pp. 144, 145 . The assessment of the war as imperialist in character and the alliance between Germany and the Soviet Union as justified was fully expressed at the third conference of the KPS in June 1940 in Vinje. The KPS referred to the social democrats and other democratic parties or groups ( Lončar's Dragotin Lončar , as an adherent of the Masaryk's principles he consistently supported Slovenianism and social reforms. In 1921 he left the JSDS because of its unitarian and centralist opinions with regard to the national question and was one of the founders of the Association of Slovenian Autonomists. In the 1930s he was, among other things, active in the opposition peasant and workers' movement. He cooperated with the opposition democrat groups, but declined any cooperation with the communists.

They also accused them of spreading disgusting propaganda against the Soviet Union. The conference expressed its distrust of all bourgeois and petty bourgeois parties, called for a consistent alignment with the Soviet Union, and expressed its conviction that a swift revolutionary momentum would be achieved. At the same time the conference, with a Bolshevik intensity, announced a resolute struggle against the opportunistic and other tendencies in the Party ranks, which could weaken its resolve and undermine the authority of its leadership.

{ "title": "Introduction", "text": "Today we can already say that the monarchy has been liquidated, even if the final decision has been put off until after the war. National oppression is over, and feudal remnants that lingered in Yugoslavia even after 1918 have been eliminated. Although we cannot equate the liberation struggle with the bourgeois-democratic revolution, we can nevertheless say that within our struggle for liberation, the stage of the bourgeois-democratic revolution has already been largely completed. And if it has not yet been completed, the conditions are ripe for its immediate elimination. This has primarily been made possible by the fact that although the bourgeoisie still retains its economic standing, it has already lost its political clout.

These are the words of Edvard Kardelj , one of Tito's closest associates alongside Aleksandar Ranković and Milovan Đilas and the person in charge of Slovenia and Croatia in the Politburo of the CK KPJ from early 1942 onward, explaining the situation of the resistance movement regarding the issue of Slovenian nationality in Spring 1944. The resolution of the national question within the unitary and centralist Kingdom of Yugoslavia that would be based on the self-determination of nations has been an important, even crucial point of the Communist policy since the 1920s. Perovšek et al. (eds.), Razprava o nacionalnem vprašanju . Kardelj's confident assessment was based on a series of ongoing processes that culminated at the second AVNOJ session in Jajce on 29 November 1943, when an ordinance declaring that Yugoslavia would be a federal country was adopted on the basis of the formal and legal right of nations to self-determination. In its plans for the post-war period, the resistance movement thus officially and formally abolished the pre-war centralist and unitarist system of government.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36290/ch06.html#p-152" },
{ "title": "Introduction", "text": "However, the road to such resolution was not always straightforward, but went through a number of contradictory phases that depended on various factors. In this context, the attitude of the Slovenian resistance towards Yugoslavia varied as well, but the resistance always remained part of the Yugoslav movement led by J. B. Tito . In the above-mentioned lecture, Kardelj explained the reasons for these changing attitudes: When we were in the middle of an offensive against reactionary forces in 1941–42 with Draža Mihailović as our main adversary, we did not emphasize Yugoslavia much as it was the main rallying cry of these reactionary elements. We mainly focused on the self-determination of the Slovenian nation and especially its right of secession. With this slogan, we destroyed the Mihailović reaction and won the masses to our side. The situation after the Italian offensive was different. At that time, Mihajlović's supporters embarked on a path of open treason. Our course was to win over the centre. This prompted us to change tactics and put the Yugoslav question on the agenda. This tactic allowed us to win over part of the centre and neutralize the rest. Our tactics always followed the needs dictated by the overall development. Therefore, we sometimes focused on secession and at other times we emphasized unification.

{ "title": "Introduction", "text": "The Fascist occupying forces failed to ensure that the division of Yugoslavia and Slovenia would also shatter KPJ and KPS. Today, KPJ is the only party with organizations all over the Yugoslav territory and the only party under a unified leadership, stressed Franc Leskošek , Secretary of the CK KPS, in his article Let Us Expand and Bolster Party Organizations (Razširimo in učvrstimo partijske organizacije) published in the August (1941) issue of Delo (The Work), a newsletter of the CK KPS. Delo 1941–1942, p. 64 . Although attitudes towards Yugoslavia were somewhat ambiguous among Croatian and Macedonian Communists, it was certainly crucial that the KPJ remained a unified organization throughout the division and occupation of Yugoslavia, with Partisan forces likewise being united under the Supreme Command headed by Secretary-General of the KPJ, Josip Broz Tito . Another constant was the fact that the KPS was always directed against the leaders of the pre-April regime, whom the Communists claimed to be the people responsible for the April catastrophe and for all evil that has befallen the Slovenian nation and all the nations of Yugoslavia after its collapse. Delo 1941–1942, (May 1942), p. 117, Delavcem, kmetom, vsemu delovnemu ljudstvu Slovenije! . Although such judgements of the Slovenian pre-war political elite by the Slovenian Communists must be considered in light of their fundamental ideological motives, the actions of the majority of pre-war party leaders upon the Axis powers' attack on Yugoslavia actually fit this description quite well, a fact that the majority of the population also agreed with. That is, based on the assessment that the war would be won by the Axis powers, the pre-war political elite headed by Ban of the Drava Banovina Dr. Marko Natlačen reacted accordingly to their aggression. Convinced that the break-up and annexation of parts of the Yugoslav territory by different Axis powers was a good long-term solution, the elites tried to negotiate – first with Germany, and after they were turned down, with Italy –a favourable outcome for the Slovenians in the context of the nazis new order, following the examples of Tiso's Slovakia and Pavelić's Independent State of Croatia (NDH) and establishing the Slovenian state as a protectorate of the Axis powers. Hitler's refusal led to the division of Slovenian territory and the pre-war elite agreeing to the annexation of the so called Province of Ljubljana to the Kingdom of Italy, the most public manifestation of which was the departure of a delegation of the Consulta (a consulting body of the Italian fascist government in the Province of Ljubljana, whose membership consisted of representatives of the Slovenian public life) to visit Mussolini and the Pope in Rome. From Yugoslavia's point of view and its legislation – the Government and the King had emigrated and were still considered the legitimate representatives of the country by the Allied forces – this was an unacceptable, prosecutable act, and from the perspective of long-term benefits for the Slovenians, the acquiescence to the partition of the Slovenian territory as a permanent solution represented the lowest point of Slovenian modern political history, as the majority of the population considered the situation a national catastrophe. Bojan Godeša : Čas odločitev. Katoliški tabor in začetek okupacije [Time of Decisions. Catholic Camp and the Beginning of the Occupation]. Ljubljana, 2011, pp. 189–258 . Due to these actions, a large part of the population – as well as allies, who thought it was totally unacceptable – considered the majority of the Slovenian pre-war party elite to have become politically disqualified, which gave legitimacy to new political powers and allowed them to take the centre stage of the future Slovenian political arena. Among these new political entities, the Liberation Front was the first to distinguish itself by calling for an immediate armed resistance against the occupying forces, and it did so with considerable success. The Liberation Front was established at the Communist's initiative; however, it was initially structured as a coalition (prominent members other than the Communists included Christian Socialists and slovene orientaited members of Sokol, a liberal organization for sports and education) and very soon became an important political entity in the Slovenian political arena.

However, the Liberation Front was able to beat the liberals with its appeal to celebrate the Yugoslavian national holiday, and its decision to do so was accompanied by the following clarification included in the flyer: As the Liberation Front of the Slovenian Nation decides to do so, we also clearly state that our liberated future must never again see the situation that had prevented the nations of Yugoslavia and the working classes from sincerely participating in the celebrations of 1 December in the past few years, the situation that has, ultimately, ruined Yugoslavia. The Liberation Front of the Slovenian Nation will liberate the Slovenian nation and guarantee all rights demanded by the Slovenian national individuality. By establishing a consistent people's democracy, the Liberation Front will guarantee the Slovenians all their human rights. We are calling upon Slovenians to celebrate 1 December in the spirit of profound and determined solidarity with their southern brothers, in the spirit of an intense struggle against the oppressors, but also with the awareness that Slovenian casualties must result in all our Slovenian and people's rights. DLRS , I/78 , p. 178 . Kardelj , who was at the time in Bosnia together with the central Yugoslav leadership headed by Tito , thus wrote a letter to the Slovenian CK an 1 January 1942 reproaching the Committee for giving concession to the reactionary elements in London and straggling behind the petite bourgeoisie and adding that this was also proven by the celebration of 1 December; Kardelj then went on to say: While we do not consider the celebration of 1 December to be negative or wrong in itself, the mere fact that you were forced into it is proof that your previous political battles failed to destroy the influence of the Greater Serbian elements and conceded to them instead. DLRS , I/109 , p. 251 . The letter also stressed that more would need to be done to popularize the Party's stance on the right of the Slovenian nation to self-determination, including secession, and that a more combative stance would have to be adopted against the Greater Serbian elements that are again turning into the most reactionary and most dangerous of all such cliques, as well as against the London clergy, who are again acting as their agents and are preparing a reprise of 1918. (…) Your criticism of the London (Yugoslav) government should be more vigorous as well, as the London government has as of yet not given even a single statement that would guarantee that the Slovenian nation would have the right to self-determination.

{ "title": "Introduction", "text": "A speech by Alojzij Kuhar , a representative of SLS in emigration, that was broadcast by the BBC on 12 April 1942 and in which Kuhar supposedly stated that the Liberation Front is misleading Slovenians with its unclear political concepts, while the goal of every respectable Slovenian is Yugoslavia and nothing but Yugoslavia, received a harsh reply with the article The Liberation Front and Yugoslavia (OF in Jugoslavija) by Edvard Kocbek , the Catholic representative in the Executive Committee of the Liberation Front. Kocbek responded that the only reason why Slovenian Londoners are charging the Liberation Front with anti-Yugoslav tendencies is because they want to reduce Yugoslavia to its past political and national form and because they only see Yugoslavia as themselves. Their selfish reasons thus lead them to opt for the past form of Yugoslavia and call it legitimate instead of joining their people and deciding on a new, revolutionary course that alone holds the promise of liberation for both Slovenians and Yugoslavia. However, while their opinion is legitimate, they conveniently forget that the reason for Yugoslavia's dissolution was precisely the Greater Serbian face of legitimacy. They conveniently forget that the hearts of patriotic Yugoslavs have by now been filled with the idea of a new Yugoslavia, cleansed of political and social parasites and included in the great Slavic bloc that will protect individual Yugoslav nations and their common political existence. Edvard Kocbek : Osvobodilni spisi [Liberation Texts], I . Ljubljana, 1991, pp. 94–95 . Kocbek concluded his thoughts with the following words: If we remain faithful to ourselves, we can achieve a great national resurrection, but if we follow Kuhar's instructions, we can only achieve a diminished Yugoslavia that will remain the sad colony it has been for the past 20 years, and within it a Slovenian sub-colony, just as the Slovenian situation has been during the period of the nation's formal freedom within Yugoslavia.

{ "title": "Introduction", "text": "Following the announcement of the Twenty-Year Mutual Assistance Agreement between the United Kingdom and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in June 1942 that had a significant impact on the new views of the liberation movement regarding future international and domestic situation, the Executive Committee of the Liberation Front issued a special pronouncement stressing that the signature marked the first agreement between two superpowers that elevates the principle of self-determination of nations to the position of the leading principle for future international relations. The Anglo-Soviet agreement thus represented the ultimate international affirmation of the policies of the Liberation Front. The text continued: They are telling you that the Liberation Front is against Yugoslavia, against Serbs and Croats. But in truth, the Liberation Front has always emphasized the need for fellowship and unity of Yugoslav nations as the unconditional principle of the common liberation struggle. The Front has stressed countless times that the Southern Slavic nations are bound by the same fate and that the organization thus believes that future national co-existence of Southern Slavic nation will certainly be realized in the form of a united country made up of these nations. Self-determination of the Slovenian nation is not contrary to a united country of Southern Slavs; however, such situation would require that the Slovenians join such country as an independent nation, taking on the responsibilities as an equal partner, consensually and voluntarily, while also asserting and preserving its rights. DLRS , II/94 . Ljubljana, 1964, p. 189 . A major clarification of the Front's attitude towards Yugoslavia was brought by the July (1942) issue of Delo, the newsletter of CK KPS. In his article KPS and Yugoslavia (KPS in Jugoslavija), Maks Stermecki explained: A rejection of the Yugoslavia as it recognized in the Treaty of Versailles with all its anti-popular and oppressive characteristics does not mean a renouncement of Yugoslavia in general. On the contrary, the struggle for self-determination and its realization is the only way of bringing our nation together with the Croats and the Serbs that could join them into a union of nations that the Greater Serbian bourgeoisie and other counter-popular elements were never able to achieve. That is, the acknowledgement of our nation's right to self-determination would eliminate the sense of national insignificance that has previously alienated us from other Yugoslav nations. DLRS , II/156 , p. 438 . Stermecki concluded his article with the following words: Instead of the old Yugoslavia, which the people and all truly democratic elements regarded as a prison of nations, a free and democratic homeland of Southern Slavic nations will rise and satisfy all their national tendencies. Ibid., p. 441 . In mid-August 1942, Slovenski poročevalec also published a reply to the allegations made by the opponents of the Partisan movement regarding the right of nations to self-determination – which was the basis for the national policy of the Communist Party and the main point of contention for these adversaries – claiming that the principle of self-determination, including the right of secession, does not immediately equal an obligation to secede and that these concepts are not interchangeable. France Škerl : Jugoslovanska ideja pri Slovencih v dobi NOB do drugega zasedanja AVNOJ [The Yugoslav Idea among Slovenians in the Period of the National Liberation Struggle until the Second Meeting of the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia]. Prispevki za zgodovino delavskega gibanja , 1974, No. 1–2, p. 221 . However, in spite of this shift, Boris Ziherl , then head of Agitprop at CK KPS, who was responsible for re-establishing connections with the centrists in Autumn 1942, wrote a letter to Kardelj dated 25 September 1942 wherein he remained extremely critical of the mistakes of the ultra-leftist nature, as he called them: The issue of self-determination with the right to secession. In the time when the strongest unity of Yugoslav nations is being forged in our national liberation struggle, we have been far too focused on secession. This principle of the right of nations to secede was never explained, we never stated that the right does not mean an obligation and that we as Communists have a duty to advocate and push against the possibility that a nation would use this right when such use would be to the nation's clear detriment. In the past few months, I have initiated a new course in the SP Slovenski poročevalec , newsletter of Liberation front of the Slovenian Nation. (…) The people immediately noticed this new course of the SP and were happy to acknowledge it. DLRS , III/111 . Ljubljana, 1966, pp. 234–235 . Ziherl then warned Kardelj : We have avoided giving clear and straightforward answers to a whole series of questions in which the petite bourgeoisie of Ljubljana is particularly intolerant, despite being able and obliged to do so. Our adversaries exploited our evasion and tried to cast everything in such light as to imply that we have tricks up our sleeves regarding these issues and do not want to show our true colours. We should not delude ourselves that they won over some of the undecided people exactly by doing this. One of such issues that we have danced around is the question of Yugoslavia. We had often wrote about Yugoslavia as a dead dog. We did issue a brochure – I do not know who wrote it – titled The Liberation Front and Yugoslavia a little over half a year ago, but I must say that the brochure did nothing to provide answers to the issue and was a classic case of beating around the bush. All this drove away numerous honest people for whom Yugoslavia remained a conditio sine qua non. I do not think it would be a hyperbole to claim that SP has only recently, in the past few months, began properly contrasting the old Yugoslavia and the new Yugoslavia that we are fighting for.

{ "title": "Introduction", "text": "Ziherl's text mentioned above was probably what prompted Slovenski poročevalec to publish a special issue, dated October 1942, with increasingly confident and explicit arguments against the defamations and allegations made against the Liberation Front in association with its attitude towards Yugoslavia. Among other things, the newspaper published the following: People are quick to allege that the Liberation Front of the Slovenian Nation is 'against Yugoslavia'. They base their claims on the fact that the LF has mercilessly exposed the faults of the old Yugoslavia of Versailles. (…) However, is criticism of the old Yugoslavia in fact 'anti-Yugoslav'? Is the Slovenian national programme in itself aimed against Yugoslavia? And finally: is the recognition that every nation must attain complete national freedom if it wants to enter an equal community of brotherly nations – anti-Yugoslav? Today, the LF can proudly announce that its Slovenian national programme was never opposed to the idea of a Yugoslav community built on the basis of national equality and the right of every nation to self-determination. And not only that! The LF may claim to be the only Slovenian organization that provided a programme and showed a practical way of how the Slovenian nation might achieve its sovereign national rights and, at the same time, create favourable conditions for the future symbiosis of Yugoslav nations, conditions for a new Yugoslavia based on national equality and mutual satisfaction of all its nations.

For Kardelj , the establishment of AVNOJ, of which Slovenians learnt through Radio Svobodna Jugoslavija, was proof that it is even now clear that Yugoslavia will be the best way for us to strengthen our international standing, as he wrote in a letter to J. B. Tito in mid-December 1942.

It is extremely regrettable that we had no representatives at the session. My proposal, to be immediately announced by the Executive Committee, is as follows: we must immediately express solidarity with the assembly, otherwise Mihailović' supporters and others will claim we have intentionally distanced ourselves and that we are 'at the mercy of some kind of Central European Soviet Union'.

Tito in mid-December 1942 had a similar emphasis: Meanwhile, this issue (author's note: the AVNOJ session in Bihać) is important for us from a different perspective as well: The main trump card of the reactionary elements has always been that we were supposedly against Yugoslavia and in favour of some 'Central European Soviet republic that would enslave our nation'. As stupid as the fabrication was, it still held sway among the masses who hate Italy and Germany so much that they no longer believe things would be better in a soviet state. We have continually emphasized our position in favour of Yugoslavia. However, as we never recognized the London government – at least not in practice – we could offer no tangible proof of this. In fact, there was a widespread desire that a unified political command would be established for the whole country, which would, to a certain extent, already include elements of a new government.

{ "title": "Introduction", "text": "The Slovenes, and their struggle against the invader, were something special. Yes there would have been no struggle if the leaders hand't been convinced that they were bringing about a turning point in the national destiny such as leaders before them had only dreamed of. In no other Yugoslav land, among no other Yugoslav people, was there such keen awareness, such enthusiasm over creation of one's own state. I myself first became aware of this during the meeting of Slovenian representives which began on. October 1 in Kočevje. This gathering was more impressive than all the previous ones. The seting, the food, the decorations of the hall were all as if one conqueror hadn't ruled there tillm yesterday, and another still more formidable one weren't on the way. Among the 562 representives from all parts of Slovenia, the number who were prominent in their field or occupation lent the session an extraordinarly historical significance. Kardelj and Kidrič had the principal role, which they acquired by virtue of their sacrifice and political talent. Yet no one adulated them; there was no presonality cult. The cult was Slovenia itself, a unanimous surge toward statehood as the crowning fulfillment of nationalism and the beginning of socialism. When Kardelj , as chief speaker, remarked that foreign rulers reffered to the Slovenes as a nation of servants, the hall murmured in the anger, only to explode with rapture when he praised the Partisans or spoke of a free Slovenia. Perhaps even more moving was the delirious unanimity of the cities, and the soldieres with wounds still fresh-all with their own litlte affairs, their own fears, yet fearless, surging inevitabily toward a national and socail ideal. The speakers and all present were caught up inn a moment of immortality. Above the podium was emblazoned a quotation from Cankar, the Slovenian man of letters: The people shall write their own destiny. Cankar was written that before the October Revolution, when socialism was regarded as the self-assertion of a benign people following the downfall of bourgeois rule. There were veryn few, if any, at that gathering who didn't know from their own experience that people had to be led by an avant-garde to be a popular one, since the people themselves were not conscious of their destiny, the ideal society. The slogan: The people shall write their own destiny dazzled and enthralled minds because it joined, indeed identified, the destiny of the people with the role of the party; all that we Communists were doing was in fact the destiny which the people were writing for themselves. And the slogan was all the more enthralling and prophetic in that it sprang from their own Slovenian socialist writer. The session was held at the night, because of the danger of an atack from the air. The night, and the isolation from the world outside, contributed to the self-containment of the gathering and its surge toward a single aim and unquestioned unity. No one before us Communists was ever so scientifically convinced that they were not only transforming a given state of affairs, but giving men and nations an ultimate and unalterable direction. All development and movement were seen as the self-fulfillment of the ideology and the party. To be sure, the course of life was not denied, but inasmuch as it was teleologically understood, it had to be directed, constructed. What was left for spontaneous, blind existence, but to submit to an omniscent and vital conscieous? Our assemblies were even then unanimous, zealously obedient to the leaders, with a sense of historic self-awareness. Yet the assembly at Kočevje was the first to attain a total, conscious, and wanton fascination with itself, with the ideas, battles, and leaders from which it sprang. Milovan Đilas : Wartime .

{ "title": "Introduction", "text": "Kardelj's speech in Kočevje was crucial for the final clarification of opinions regarding the internal organization of the united country. Previously, the Executive Committee of the Liberation Front decided at its session of 12 th September 1943 that an opinion should be formed regarding Yugoslavia as a federal unit and AVNOJ should be declared as the government, which would resolve the issue of the London government. ( Dokumenti organov in organizacij narodnoosvobodilnega gibanja v Sloveniji [Documents of the National Liberation Movement Authorities and Organisations in Slovenia], XI/72 . Ljubljana, 2012, p. 337 ). Among other things, Kardelj said the following: And there is another principle that we have to discuss loudly and clearly today. People in London keep saying: after the occupiers collapse, the Slovenian nation will be free, but it is too early to put the federal issue on the agenda. The workings of this federation, say the hypocrites in London, will be discussed and decided after the war. What this post-war discussion would look like is indicated by the fact that these reactionary gentlemen in London were never to agree even among themselves. In this regard, we are not going to tolerate any more doubts or beating around the bush. The Slovenian nation joins the future Yugoslavia on its own accord, bolstered by its right of self-determination. The federal system of the future Yugoslavia cannot be in doubt any longer, nor can the fact that the Slovenian nation will be a separate, self-governing federal unit in the future country. And if the gentlemen in London remain doubtful about this, they should be told that we have already settled this matter in a brotherly agreement with our brotherly Yugoslav nations. Our activities are based on the principles of the right to self-determination and equality in this joint Southern Slavic homeland.

At the meeting of the Slovenian delegation with J. B.

Some new highlights could be observed in Kidrič's article Let Us Learn from Our Southern Brothers! (Učimo se pri južnih bratih!) published after the return of the Slovenian delegation from Jajce: At last let me speak about the genuine Yugoslav spirit that is so strong in the South of the country. There is no doubt that the dissolution in April and the incitement by national traitors had created terrible chaos in the South, which threatened a slaughter between Serbs and Croats that could have ended with their extinction. Today, the whole world is in awe of the national liberation movement that managed to stop the chaos and forged an unbreakable kinship and unity between Southern Slavic nations. At this point, I want to emphasize the fact that has been the most pleasant surprise of all, i.e. that the genuine Yugoslav spirit has penetrated the consciousness of the masses in all its detail . You can hardly find a Serb who would blame Croats for the atrocities committed by the Ustashe. You can hardly hear a chauvinist expression or profanity aimed at a person of a different Souther Slavic nationality. However, there is a strong will to learn everything and to personally apply everything good that was created by other Southern Slavic nations. Despite doing our share for the establishment of a new Yugoslavia and the fact that no one can reproach us for not being dedicated to Yugoslavia, us Slovenians have a lot to learn in this regard. We are all too focused solely on our own wartime experience, all too confined in our own little circle. It would serve us well to learn from the positive experiences of other Southern Slavic nations and apply them to ourselves. It is understandable that learning from the brotherly South during the time of old Yugoslavia was difficult and frustrating because we were used to the proponents of Greater Serbian hegemony from the South to bring us nothing but oppression. The situation today is completely different. An egalitarian Yugoslavia is being formed, and for the benefit of ourselves and this egalitarian country, we have to learn from our southern brothers as they have to learn from us.

The Slovenian nation, vulnerable on all sides to the greed of foreign imperialism, would become its victim if it weren't for the simultaneous resistance of other Yugoslav nations. (…) today, we can enter the Yugoslav concept without worries regarding our national rights. Nowadays, we still fear the old Yugoslavia and think that a Yugoslav community represents a threat to the independent development of the Slovenian nation. It often happens that when we express our thoughts of liberation we do not stress enough the connection to Yugoslavia. However, we have to realize that without Yugoslavia there can be no continuation of the policies and struggles for the liberation of the Slovenian nation. Even our press does not take advantage of the successes of Yugoslav liberation movements in other parts of the country.

A typical reflection of the post-AVNOJ mood and the efforts made for the promotion of Yugoslavia is Kidrič's article More Yugoslavism (Več jugoslovanstva) published in Summer 1944, after the author had found himself in isolation for his supposedly arbitrary decisions regarding the acceptance of British loans. In the article, Kidrič criticized the Slovenian narrow-mindedness and lack of interest in anything beyond the borders of our immediate homeland. Kidrič warned that our press was slow to renounce its noticeable Slovenian exclusivity, that our meetings and conferences were all too concerned with the irrelevant issues regarding the liberated and non-liberated Slovenian territory, that our masses were poorly informed and know little of the casualties and superhuman efforts, of the glorious victories and magnificent events taking place all over Yugoslavia, and that our activists are not interested in the events or developments across other countries of our Yugoslav homeland as well as elsewhere in the world, that the legal connections between the Yugoslav issues and global events remained hidden, and that they continue, to their sole detriment, to look at everything from a narrow Slovenian viewpoint.

{ "title": "The Formation of Armed Units of the Resistance Movement in Slovenia", "text": "Two weeks after the attack on the Soviet Union, the leadership of the until then illegal Yugoslav Communist Party (KPJ) in the already occupied and divided Kingdom of Yugoslavia decided to initiate resistance against all four occupiers (Germany, Italy, Bulgaria and Hungary) and the newly founded Independent State of Croatia, to organise guerrilla resistance units and to compel its members to join these units and start an armed struggle.

Stanford, 2001 . The objective of the resistance struggle was national liberation, but it also included a hidden and decisive agenda that the KPJ would assume an important role in the future government system, if not come to full power during the struggle and particularly at the end of the war.

As it is usual for guerrilla warfare, local circumstances were important in the organisation of the resistance because resistance units could only develop from the bottom up, i.e. from local forces and resources which are necessary for any armed struggle. The leadership of the KPJ, which at the same time took over the leadership of the resistance, decided also at higher levels on a distributed principle because the new occupational borders which divided the state territory – Yugoslavia was divided into 11 different occupational areas – represented a great obstacle for achieving their aims because of different conditions for crossing them and different occupational policies. The organisational policy of the guerrilla warfare was at the same time also in line with its general orientation in the domestic politics, which advocated a Yugoslav state, but one that consisted of more (at least five) nations forming national administrative units, which was contrary to the unitary model of the previous Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1941, the politicians encouraged the creation of national guerrilla commanding units (the so called Main commands of Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia, Sandžak, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Vojvodina, Macedonia), which could lead the guerrilla units on their territories more easily in times of difficult communication with each other. The KPJ tried to oversee and guide the activities of these guerrilla units. See Pirjevec , Tito in tovariši , pp. 91–98 . For this purpose, the leadership formed the Main Command of the Yugoslav National Liberation Partisan Detachments The military leadership named itself the Main Command of the Yugoslav National Liberation Partisan Detachment in September 1941, the Main Command of the Yugoslav National Liberation and Volunteer Army in January 1942, and from November 1942 it was called the Supreme Command of the Yugoslav National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments. – Vojna enciklopedija , 10 . Belgrade, 1975 . , mostly consisting of the most powerful political leaders, members of the highest political bodies with Josip Broz Tito , the Secretary-General of the KPJ, as the highest supreme commander. Morača , Jugoslavija 1941 , pp. 163–164 . Pirjevec , Tito in tovariši , p. 93 . The organisers, leadership of the KPJ and Supreme Command considered the Partisan Army, as they named the members of the guerrilla units, as an unified army, even though this uniformity was not achieved for a long time, not in the organisational and even less in the operational sense. Each of the partisan armies operated in their respective Yugoslav regions under the leadership of regional political bodies and their own commands. The Supreme Command had the supremacy only by name. They all had to operate with their own forces, taking into account current circumstances that were more or less suitable for armed resistance. Soon after the beginning of the resistance in July 1941, great differences in the inner development and power of the resistance movement arose, even though its leaders obeyed the (very) general guidelines and instructions from the highest command of the party and its military command. In the beginning, the partisan army mobilized most quickly in Serbia and Montenegro, where it was joined by a huge number of members as soon as in the summer of 1941. Morača , Jugoslavija 1941 , pp. 169–182, 224–228, 447–452 . In 1941, the Supreme Command of national liberation units was forced to deal especially with the issues regarding the partisan units in Serbia, where the Supreme Command was located, and could interfere in other resistance territories only occasionally, in writing or through delegates and individual members, but mostly it had to rely on the initiative of the leadership of individual resistance movements which, as members of the KPJ, fully recognized the authority of KPJ leaders, the Politburo of the KPJ and personally equal the Main, i.e. the Supreme Command. The difference between the centralist hierarchy of the Communist Party and the military subordination was not that significant as to cause any problems to the leadership. The guerrilla therefore had support also on the organisational level and in operational methods of the Yugoslav Communist Party. The communists also attracted other political groups and individuals to the resistance, but mostly in an informal way. Only in Slovenia did the Communist Party of Slovenia formalise this cooperation with other political groups in the resistance organisation called the Liberation Front of the Slovenian Nation, in which the communists were the most important and most radical political party, but they did not have the greatest number of members. Other groups joined the resistance organisation with the aim of achieving national liberation, and not so much for the radical social changes. See Eva Mally : Slovenski odpor.

This opened up a potential area of conflict between them and their national and revolutionary goals which affected the formation and goals of an armed struggle against the occupational forces, as well as the relationship between the national (Slovenian) and the Yugoslav leadership of the resistance movement. At the end of July 1941, the Slovenian communists included an armed force, which they also originally established in Slovenia, into the Liberation Front as its armed force, which was not the case in other Yugoslav regions.

{ "title": "The Formation of Armed Units of the Resistance Movement in Slovenia", "text": "When, in September 1941, the leadership of the Slovenian resistance movement formally confirmed the fact that it will act as part of the Yugoslav resistance, the leadership of the Liberation Front, which proclaimed itself on the 16 th September as a temporary national representation called the Slovenian National Liberation Committee, also arranged their relationship with the Yugoslav leadership of the armed resistance. The Slovenian partisan army was also formally included into the common Yugoslav partisan army. Its ordinance defined the inclusion of the Slovenian partisan units as an inclusion of an autonomous and complete organisation under the command of its Supreme Command into the military organisation which was under the command of the Main Command of the Yugoslav National Liberation Partisan Units. DLRS I. , doc. 40 . Because the Liberation Front was a coalition, such an explicit decision was politically necessary, but at the same time it showed reservations of at least some of the political groups towards the current Yugoslav reality and the emphasized sensitivity of the Slovenian people towards the reinstatement of national sovereignty and especially towards their own military organisation which felt estranged to the Slovenians in the centralist state because it was under a strong Serbian personal and traditional predominance. Such inclusion meant that the Slovenian partisan army started to developed into a direction that was generally determined by the Supreme Command and the commanders attended a meeting of partisan commands in Stolice. Morača , Jugoslavija 1941 , pp. 479–489 . In winter 1941, following the directions of the Supreme Command, the separation from the Yugoslav Army in the homeland took place which was led by colonel and later general Dragoljub Mihailović . However, the Executive committee of the Liberation Front (the Slovenian National Liberation Committee was no longer active) became the formal supreme commander of the Slovenian partisan army and confirmed military appointments to the highest level.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36291/ch07.html#p-185" },

In this relationship, the Slovenian partisan units with their command were a separate and complete part of the Yugoslav partisan army, but they had their own forces and capabilities and were independent in their activities, if we ignore the periodical instructions of the Supreme Command regarding the military organisation and operational plans, which were given more as an advice. The operational leadership of the units was still conducted at lower levels, by the so called command of detachment groups and operational zones . The communicational abilities of the Supreme Command did not allow them to interfere with the command of the Slovenian partisan units at a strategic level.

{ "title": "The Formation of Armed Units of the Resistance Movement in Slovenia", "text": "In autumn 1942, vague organisational models and competences caused the first serious crisis in the command of the military force of the Slovenian resistance movement. This happened during a huge crisis due to the Italian radical cleansing in the Province of Ljubljana, the armed collaboration and the beginning of the civil war. In November 1942, Josip Broz Tito , the commander of the Supreme Command, send the head of his headquarters, captain Arsa Jovanović , and additional 11 officers to Slovenia, with a task to transform the Slovenian partisan units into militarily more effective formations. The reason for this decision were the pessimistic assessments about the possibilities and abilities of the Slovenian partisan army and its highest commanders, which were send by Josip Kopinič and Edvard Kardelj to the Supreme Command during the Italian offensive in 1942.

Inštitut za novejšo zgodovino, Zbrana dela Edvarda Kardelja , 6, 38: Poročilo E. Kardelja J. Brozu Titu , 20 September 1942 . But the reason was also deeper, since it also concerned various aspects regarding the management of the relationships between the Yugoslav nations at the time when the leadership of the resistance movement decided to form its own Yugoslav unions. See Godeša , Prispevek k poznvanju Dolomitske izjave, pp. 601–603 . Pirjevec , Tito in tovariši , pp. 125–126 . The supreme commander Tito authorized Jovanović to implement the experience and organisation of the partisan units of the Supreme Command also in Slovenia. In fact, this authorisation made him a temporary commander of the Slovenian partisan army, with the right to personally shape its headquarters. SI AS 1487, box 5041, Pooblastilo A. Jovanoviću , 17 November 1942 . After arriving on the Slovenian territory, Jovanović , who was a former active officer of Yougoslav army, without sufficient political and diplomatic tact, implemented the organisational models of the units of the Supreme Command, enlarged brigades by including the enlisted men of the territorial detachments, degraded and appointed commanders of units, and forced political commissioners to replace the Liberation Front badges on their uniforms with KPY badges because he wanted to uniform the Slovenian partisan army with the practice of the central resistance group. He did all that without informing the Main Command, i.e. the leadership of the liberation movement. Zbornik dokumentov in podatkov o narodnoosvobodilni vojni jugoslovanskih narodov, VI.

His approach, which would be quite understandable in the hierarchy of a military organisation, sparked a harsh political reaction from the leadership of the resistance movement. After he returned to the headquarters of the leadership in Polhograjsko hribovje (20 km north-west from Ljubljana), he was confronted both by the leadership of KPS and the Executive Committee of the Liberation Front. The members of the latter asked if the partisan army is still under their supreme command, as it was since July 1941. ZDPNV, VI/4 , doc. 136 and VI/5, doc. 6, 12 . The leading officials of the KPS, who were committed to the party discipline and the leadership of the Supreme Command, but were also (national) leaders of the Liberation Front, found themselves in a dilemma which they solved with a compromise. The non-communist members of the Liberation Front leadership were satisfied with the formulation that Jovanović , the head of the Supreme Command, may reorganise the military organisation only in consensus with the Executive Committee of the Liberation Front. However, they actually allowed Jovanović to co-command the Slovenian partisan army together with the commander of the Main Command, to reorganise it from the so-called detachment groups to operational zones, and to relocate the commanders of headquarters and larger units for another two months until he returned to Supreme Command in Bosnia. The officers he brought with him and who should be appointed as commanders of the Slovenian brigades were, upon a compromise, appointed as deputy commanders and headquarters' heads of zones, brigades and battalions where they could use their military knowledge, but the commanders of these units remained Slovenians. And Šaranović , who was to become the new commander of the Slovenian Main Command, was appointed as the head of the Main Command. Considering the nationally-based reaction of the members of the Executive Committee of the Liberation Front and some of the commanders, Edvard Kardelj summed up the entire conflict in a letter, in which he emphasized that because of the national-liberation character of the resistance movement, the commander of the partisan army on the Slovenian territory must remain a Slovenian.

In May 1943, the secretary of the Executive Committee of the Liberation Front and one of the leading communists Boris Kidrič , who was just explicitly criticized by the leadership of the Yugoslav resistance because of his reserved standpoint towards the Yugoslav community, proposed to the Executive Committee of the Liberation Front that they transfer their power to appoint the highest commanders in the Slovenian partisan army to the Supreme Command. The communists leading the Slovenian resistance movement had to once again encourage the Yugoslav integration processes. The Executive Committee discussed the proposal at their meeting on 23 rd and 24 th May 1943. Its member Josip Rus (member of liberal group) turned the proposal into a discussion about the political structure of the future state, pointing out that the assignment of military authority to the Supreme Command without any guarantees about the federal structure of the future state means foremost the restoration of the previous relations in the state, i.e. Unitarianism, which was unacceptable for him and contrary of the Liberation Front programme.

The control of the army was very important in this process. By mid‑1944, the principle of a unified Yugoslav Army which was fully subordinate to the central leadership finally prevailed in the leadership of the resistance movement, but not without opposition. The communists in the Slovenian and Croatian leadership of the resistance movement were pointing out that such organisation is premature because it is politically damaging as it weakens the national influence of the partisan army and with that the response of the population.

In 1944, the Supreme Command acquired a number of new levers of leadership and command and, in the autumn of 1944, unified the military judiciary, organizational and formational regime, and introduced centralized awarding of officer ranks – first for commanders, then for political commissars.

From November 1944 to January 1945, the mobilisation of every male resident from Belgrade to south Macedonia was carried out, several new military units were established and the partisan army was renamed into the army of the Democratic and Federal Yugoslavia with three armies. This process ended on 1 st March 1945 with the renaming of the Yugoslav NOV in PO into Yugoslav Army, which then founded the fourth army in Dalmatia. At the same time, the priorities of the operational activities of the Yugoslav Army changed – its most important tasks were the final operations and the breakthrough at the so called Syrmian and Bosnian front, which was established by the German army as it retreated to the north-west.

This was also reflected in the formation of its military forces. Patriotism, which was based on nationalism, was an important factor for mobilizing the population for the guerrilla army, which was crucially dependent on the voluntary mobilization and support of the local population. The solutions which the resistance movement tried to implement under the leadership of the Communists were a compromise. They formally maintained some elements of the (Slovenian) national army, but in fact it was the communists who, in the name of discipline as well as their special objective of a revolutionary takeover, led the army into a similar centralist organisational form as it was before the war in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia – which is imminent in the military organisation. However, this model took its final shape only when it was no longer politically decisive, since they seized power and became the political foundation of a new Yugoslav statehood during the final operations against the Nazi Germany in Yugoslavia. The army, which was named Yugoslav Army in the first post-war years, was, as the sum of all influences, an institution which clearly supported the centralistic revolutionary authority, despite the formal federal organisation of the state. The unrealised formal competence of the Slovenian federal state in the military field became something unspoken, but internally present in the internal political developments of the next 36 years of the socialist Slovenia.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36291/ch07.html#p-199" },

Julian Jackson : France. The Dark Years 1940–1944 . Oxford, 2001, p. 173 . Later on, the concept came to apply to other aspects of the relationship between the occupying forces and the occupied territory and population as well, primarily the aspects that are disparagingly called aiding the enemy, supporting the occupying forces, working against fundamental national interests or even treason or high treason. However, modern historiography of World War II is giving more and more attention to the study of this complex and sometimes contradictory phenomenon. In addition to concrete particulars of each instance of collaboration, the various increasingly thorough monographs as well as comparative studies are now directing their critical analyses as well as both original and unoriginal systematizations towards the very concept of collaboration as well.

Most researchers agree that the decisive agent in this dichotomy is generally the occupying force, who makes decisions, i.e. allows for, wants or even demands the cooperation of the occupied. Various systems of occupation established primarily by the Nazis across Europe – from the Channel Islands to the Caucasus – thus represent the natural framework as well as a conditio sine qua non that determines the nature and extent of collaboration that would occur and even whether it would occur at all. Jan T. Gross : Themes for a Social History of War Experience and Collaboration. In: The Politics of Retribution in Europe. World War II and its Aftermath . Princeton, 2000, pp. 24–25 .

This was only the case with some more or less Nazified German minorities, i.e. Volksdeutschers, who also frequently acted as the fifth column following the occupation. On the other hand, researchers have generally come to agree that only a minority of the population usually participated in active resistance. But if that was so, did the rest of the population collaborate as well? While this is obviously a rhetorical question with a negative answer, the fact remains that the majority had to somehow adapt to the new situation and choose a strategy of surviving the occupation in accordance with their values, abilities and own judgement of the situation. As our subject here is collaboration, the dilemma can also be rephrased as the question of what degree of social interaction with the enemy is still compatible with patriotism or the generally expected degree and form of loyalty to one's homeland. Rab Bennett : Under the Shadow of the Swastika. The Moral Dilemmas of Resistance and Collaboration in Hitler's Europe . New York, 1999, p. 71 . As we have indicated above, the answers to this question have ranged from passive acceptance to voluntary and active support for the administration of the occupying forces or even ideological identification with them.

{ "title": "Ideological Basis of Collaboration in Europe During World War II and a Short Comparison with Slovenia", "text": "Of course, this is not the place to expound on the complexity and specific features of collaboration in Europe; however, we do have to return briefly to the issue of the Nazi occupation policy and even the war goals of the Axis powers, particularly of Hitler's Reich. With regard to the global government of Europe after the presumed German victory, it has to be said that neither the Nazi command nor Hitler were explicitly concerned with the issue and that the only constant of the Nazi policy in this regard was simply the creation of the great German Reich that would, naturally, include the Baltic area, and presumably also Ukraine, in addition to the Czech Republic and Poland. In any case, the Nazi interests were particularly targeted to the east of Europe (Generalplan Ost), while the Nazi's concerns regarding the Western and Northern Europe were mostly associated with the question whether the Reich should include other Germanic countries as well or whether a different pan-Germanic community should be created. With this plan, France would be reduced to its circa-1500 borders. In the context of the ideas of the so-called New Europe or European Community, the Nazi circles sporadically came up with ideas such as the seven European federations joined in a kind of super-federation. The most serious yet still unofficial document in this regard was drafted in March 1943 by Ribbentrop's Foreign Ministry, which discussed a European union of sovereign countries and represented a kind of an answer to the Allies' Atlantic Charter. The following year, the central SS office in Berlin published a similar document planning a German Reich at the core of Europe surrounded by a circle of neighbouring peoples as well as the outer circle of the so-called Randvölker. The whole arrangement would be called the Europäische Eidgenossenschaft. The plans even included a European passport. Hans Werner Neulen : An deutscher Seite.

{ "title": "Ideological Basis of Collaboration in Europe During World War II and a Short Comparison with Slovenia", "text": "Regardless of such ideas, which were probably encouraged by thoughts of an increasingly improbable Nazi victory, the course of the war and especially the initial, concrete occupation policies and arrangements undoubtedly showed that the Nazi plans were primarily focused, as already mentioned, on the creation of a great German Reich with its great economic environment in the context of the so-called Lebensraum. Polish historian Madajczyk thus classifies the main objectives and phases of the Nazi occupation policies into four stages: 1) Creation of the German Lebensraum in the East, 2) Preliminary preparations for the creation of the great German Reich through the absorption of German Volksgruppen and Germanic peoples, 3) Securing a long-term or eternal subjugation of different regions with the help of the other Axis powers, 4) Occasional and limited interventions in other areas. Madajczyk , Zwischen neutralen Zusammenarbeit der Bevölkerung okkupierter Gebiete, p. 49 . As a matter of fact, the Nazi mechanism of subjugation and oppression manifested itself as the three main types of occupation. The first type was characterized by the direct expansion of the Reich's government to the annexed territories annexed de iure or de facto (part of eastern Belgium, Luxembourg, Alsace, part of Lorraine, western Poland, Sudetenland, Lower Styria and Upper Carniola). The second type includes occupied territories with different forms of civilian administration (Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Polish General Government, Reichskommissariat Ostland, Reichskommissariat Ukraine), and the third includes territories under military administration (Channel Islands, Belgium, northern France, Serbia, parts of Greece and of course other areas following the capitulation of Italy).

{ "title": "Ideological Basis of Collaboration in Europe During World War II and a Short Comparison with Slovenia", "text": "Within these systems of occupation, explicit German needs and incentives accompanied by their dissemination among the inhabitants of the occupied territories resulted in different forms and degrees of collaboration. The behaviour patterns in the native population which reflected to nothing more than efforts to survive and preserve the normal course of public life were helpful for the occupying forces as well. They allowed or sought higher forms of collaboration only in case they deemed them potentially beneficial in the short or perhaps even long term. The whole body of collaboration was thus – self-evidently – in the service of the realization of Nazi control over the occupied territories and therefore also indirectly in the service of successful continuation of the war effort. From such perspective, it is crystal clear that the tolerance of collaboration in Eastern Europe was nothing more than a tactical manoeuvre. A German victory would mean that collaborators as relatively autonomous entities and, in particular, their non-German national affiliation would have to disappear. In this regard, things were different in Western Europe as the Nazis did not have any final plans for that region; of course, collaboration was welcomed, but it was especially the political collaboration that represented something of a double-edged sword for the Nazis since it implied a certain type of partnership and therefore also future obligations. With minor exceptions in the Baltic area, the Nazis tried to avoid such obligations, especially in the East, where such commitments were completely out of the question. Hans Umbreit : Die Rolle der Kollaboration in der deutschen Besatzungspolitik. In: Europa unterm Hakenkreuz , pp. 33-44 . That the focus was primarily on the short-term concrete interests of the occupying administration is also indicated by the seemingly unusual fact that Germans sometimes turned down cooperation with minor local Fascist groups, preferring instead to set up an administration on their own or in collaboration with other domestic political forces who enjoyed greater support among the population. Such was the case in Poland and the Czechia on the one hand, and on the other there were the cases of Belgium and Denmark.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36292/ch08.html#p-205" },

Each example will be followed by a description of the forms of collaboration, wherein we will focus on the ideological foundations or backgrounds that had resulted in such varying forms and degrees of collaboration. It is precisely under the ideological aspect of the relationship between the occupying power and the occupied people that the phenomenon of collaboration is usually shown in its clearest and most extreme form, and this is where explicit support to the occupying power as well as identification with the Nazis are most evident – in such cases, collaboration is voluntary and the most intense. The first direct manifestation of an ideology which was identical with or obviously related to National Socialism was the ideological collaboration in the narrow sense; in this regard, various Fascist and para-Fascist movements or parties that may have been active even before the occupation or many of them appearing and becoming active after the country had been occupied should be mentioned. A typical example in this category were the so-called Paris “collaborationism”, who were labelled by using this term in order to distinguish them from the national collaboration of Vichy. Dominique Veillon : La collaboration . Paris, 1984, p. 179–225 . The ideological potential, of course, does not only result in ideological collaboration and the directly related political collaboration, but can also act as an incentive and a trigger for other types of collaboration, e.g. voluntary enrolment in the SS in order to actively participate in the fight against Bolshevism. Such motivations, of course, cannot be excluded even in cases of economic collaboration. In this regard, the contrasting cases of Renault and Michelin are often cited. The former voluntarily offered to manufacture tanks for the Germans, but even the latter, albeit being in contact with the resistance, had to somehow do business with the occupying forces.

{ "title": "Ideological Basis of Collaboration in Europe During World War II and a Short Comparison with Slovenia", "text": "Based on direct Hitler's instructions, among other things, the administration of the German occupying forces immediately started to show favouritism for the Flemish part of Belgium, to which the Germans also included the city of Brussels. In addition to linguistic and political aspects, the favouritism was primarily reflected by the fact that the Germans were quick to release the Flemish prisoners of war, while those of the Walloon origin had to remain in captivity. In any case, collaboration in Belgium was started immediately and was evident in all areas of life. The main ideological basis for collaboration was the Flemish nationalism, Belgian version of Fascism and a rather widespread rejection of democracy. The Flemish nationalism was practised by different parties and movements characterized by varying degrees of extremism and flirtation with the German Nazism. The largest such party was the Flemish National Union (Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond, VNV), which supported Flemish independence and, in perspective, what was called Dietsland, i.e. a national union of all Dutch-speaking countries, which, according to VNV, included Luxembourg, which would later become part of the German federation. The Germans were not too enthusiastic about the idea, but they did liked receiving favours from the Flemish nationalists who soon took over positions in the council of secretaries-general as well as all lower administrative levels. Besides, VNV supported a social regime based on the people's solidarity and corporate programme. Among other, more extreme Flemish groups, there was also the Union of Dutch National Solidarists (Verbond van Dietsche National-Solidaristen, Verdinaso) and the German-Flemish Labour Community (Duitschen-Vlamsche Arbeidsgemeenschap, Devlag). The latter was explicitly pro-German; it supported the idea of annexing Flanders to the German Reich and later became something of Heinrich Himmler's personal Belgian party that was the first to advocate the establishment of Flemish SS units. Neulen , An deutscher Seite , pp. 67–68 . In Wallonia, Léon Degrelle with his Rexist Movement (Rex) was the most prominent among those who worked with the Nazis. Degrelle , who followed the examples of Mussolini , Franco and Salazar , wanted to create an authoritarian, corporate country that would be organized as an expanded Flemish-Walloon federation. However, his vision was extended even further, towards a renewal of a kind of Burgundy that would, of course, also include parts of northern France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Martin Conway : Collaboration in Belgium. Léon Degrelle and the Rexist Movement 1940–1944 . New Haven, London, 1993, pp. 33–34, 179 . Degrelle is also notable for having been among the few non-Germans that Hitler was friendly with. His pro-German policies went so far as Degrelle declaring Walloons to be German and saying that Belgium should, accordingly, become part of the great German Reich. Wilfried Wagner : Belgien in der deutschen Politik während des Zweiten Weltkrieges . Boppard am Rhein, 1974, pp. 198–205 . Conway , Collaboration in Belgium , p. 173 . In his case, as well as the case of Flemish collaborationists, the programmes and propaganda appearances came to be increasingly dominated with Nazi phraseology and its leitmotif of the struggle for the European civilization. Jacques Willequet : Les fascismes belges et la Seconde guerre mondiale. Revue d'histoire de la deuxième guerre mondiale , 1967, No. 66, p. 100 . However, as the German defeat became more and more inevitable, it seemed that even Degrelle had trouble in understanding what was the point of the war. At the Vienna assembly of the European National Socialists in December 1944, Degrelle bluntly asked the Nazi command to tell him what we're fighting for and not only what we're fighting against. Europe has to have a clear goal for after the war. What is this goal? David Littlejohn : The Patriotic Traitors. A History of Collaboration in German Occupied Europe 1940/1945 .

In any case, the Nazi regime always treated the German-speaking Luxembourgers as Germans, so all further measures taken by the occupying administration were focused on what was called the return to the Reich (Heim ins Reich). Following a one-month period of military administration, Luxembourg was practically annexed to the Reich as its territory was annexed to Gau Koblenz-Trier, which was renamed into Gau Moselland in February 1941. Gauleiter Gustav Simon also became chief of the civilian administration and his activities during the initial months were centred primarily on the dismantling of Luxembourg's statehood, eventually allowing Simon to solemnly declare that Luxembourg had ceased to exist and to forbid any use of the name.

Individual Nazi measures prompted demonstrations and strikes, which in turn led to bloody German countermeasures and to the Nazis starting, though not finishing, limited deportation of Luxembourger families to Silesia. Gauleiter Simon even came up with a referendum, at which Luxembourgers were supposed to provide answers to concrete questions affirming their German affiliation. However, the referendum was a fiasco, as 98 % of responses indicated that the people considered themselves Luxembourgers by culture and nationality and their language Luxembourgish. The Gauleiter was forced to invalidate the referendum. Gilbert Trausch : Le Luxembourg à l'époque contemporaine . Luxembourg, 1981, p. 155 . However, pressures mounted and the Nazis initially instituted a compulsory labour scheme and then also a compulsory military service in August 1942, upon the granting of limited citizen rights. Recruitment involved those born between 1920 and 1927, over 15,000 draftees in total, however, draft evasion and desertion led to only a little over 11,000 actually joining the German army, of which almost 3,000 died on various fronts. The previously mentioned volunteer troop, which Himmler held in very high regard, was mobilized as well. The troop members went on a rightful Odyssey across Europe, with the journey having a tragic end for many of them due to resistance.

Very few Luxembourgers were open to being convinced that they were actually Germans. Prior to the occupation, the grand duchy did not have any Nazi organizations , with the Luxemburger Volksjugend, an organization established by Albert Kreins as a copy of the Nazi Hitlerjugend, perhaps coming closest. Luxemburg Collaborationist Forces During WWII . Available at: http://www.feldgrau.com/a-lux.html , 16 March 2007 .

In order to expedite the Germanification of Luxembourgers, the Gauleiter established the extensive Volksdeutsche Bewegung organization as early as July 1940, and although membership was not compulsory, people were pressured to join in order to keep their jobs, etc. The organization was initially headed by Prof. Damian Kratzenberg , a member of a small group of leaders who actually held pro-Nazi opinions, which in turn directed his propaganda. Luxembourgers resented this, and so Kratzenberg became one of the few Luxembourgers to be sentenced to death for collaboration after the war. Franz W. Seidler : Die Kollaboration 1939–1945 . Munich, Berlin, 1995, pp. 296–298 . In any case, the organization acquired 84,000 members by May 1942, however, researchers estimate that only a bit more than 5 % of these joined because of their convictions. Furthermore, the Nazi authorities urged Luxembourgers to enter NSDAP, i.e. the Nazi party, and its professional organizations, and men in particular to volunteer for the SS and Wehrmacht. About 4,000 Luxembourgers joined the NSDAP, and local historians consider these to have been authentic collaborationists. Gilbert Trausch : Histoire du Luxembourg , pp. 173–174 .

During the occupation, the brunt of Nazi measures was born by Alsace and part of Lorraine, areas that Germany was forced to cede to the French after the country's defeat in 1918. Provisions of the armistice made no mention of the Alsace and Lorraine status, however, this fact was of course ignored by the Nazis. The Alsatian departments of Haut-Rhin and Bas-Rhin were annexed to Gau Baden, while the Lorraine department of Moselle was joined to Gau Westmark. Božo Repe : Francija med drugo svetovno vojno.

German laws and regulations were gradually introduced, while the French legislation and eventually any French presence at all, were simultaneously eliminated. Gauleiters Joseph Bürckel (Moselle) and Robert Wagner (Alsace) were initially appointed as chiefs of civilian administration. This, along with the fact that the complete institution of German legislation and presence of all Nazi institutions failed to actually result in an explicit, formal annexation, has led French researchers to describe the formal attitude of the German authorities to these regions as annexion de fait sui generis.

In France, the Nazis carried out assimilation measures that were similar to those in Luxembourg, with the important difference, however, that they included an extensive campaign of deportation of those that were assessed to potentially be difficult to Germanize. During 1941 and 1942, 92,000 people in a series of waves were thus deported from Lorraine to unoccupied France, including the Bishop of Metz and about a hundred members of the clergy; the Catholic Church was also the target of other measures.

About 8,000 Lorrainers were moved to Silesia and Sudetenland. Alsatians suffered a similar fate, accompanied by the settlement of Volksdeutschers from elsewhere. French and German Jews living in both regions were also temporarily deported to France. In terms of expected measures, this was followed by a more or less compulsory involvement of the population in large organizations (Deutsche Volksgemeinschaft), by a compulsory labour scheme in April 1942 and by an announcement of compulsory military service accompanied by the draftees receiving a German citizenship in August 1942. In both regions, 200,000 young men were drafted, with about 40,000 failing to return home, most of whom of course fell on the Russian Front. In 1944, Alsace and Lorraine also saw compulsory mobilization into the SS. Ibid., pp. 326–327 .

After military operations concluded in September 1939, the Polish territory occupied by Germany was, as previously planned, split into two parts. The western territories with an area of 90,000 km 2 and a population of almost 10 million were annexed to the Reich. They were joined to Gau Wartheland (Posen), Gau Upper Silesia and Gau Danzig-Western Prussia. After some hesitation by Hitler regarding the creation of the so-called Restaat Polen, the rest of Poland was assigned the status of a semi-colonial dependent territory and named General Government (Generalgouvernement). In this part of Poland, all power was held by the German civilian administration headed by General Governor Hans Frank and based in Krakow. However, following the attack on the Soviet Union, the district of Galicia was annexed to the Government as well. According to Hitler's and Himmler's plans, the annexed territories would be Germanized within ten years; the measures that followed in order to achieve this brought an unprecedented level of terror waged against a European nation. The intelligentsia, the clergy and other distinguished Polish classes were killed, taken to concentration camps or deported to the General Government without any concern paid to their needs. Together with other categories, 750,000 people were deported there, and deportation of a few million more was being planned. Polish Jews suffered a similar fate, only worse. All traces of Polish cultural and general presence were destroyed, while the seized and emptied estates and areas were settled by Germans from elsewhere, primarily those from the Baltic countries.

In these regions, Nazis allowed no activities that could be called Polish whatsoever, not even collaboration. Ideology and politics had nothing to do with this, any reasons for potential cooperation with the authorities, which was only possible at the individual level, were distinctively social. It was about survival and keeping up at least an appearance of a minimum preservation of human dignity. This became particularly apparent in the mass enlistment of Poles to the so-called Deutsche Volksliste” which the Nazis formed in western Poland, initially to serve as something of a list of the German population. The organization had four divisions, ranging from pure and active Germans to the so-called renegades. The last two categories were able to obtain German citizenship; however, this was subject to revocation. Because Germanization was slow, pragmatic reasons led Nazis to at least outwardly allow extremely broad integration, which led to over two million former Polish citizens being included on the list. However, as they became German citizens, they also became subject to compulsory military service. About 200,000 Poles were thus drafted into the Wehrmacht. Madajczyk wonders whether these were renegades. He doesn't provide an answer, however, he sometimes uses a label indicating that at least some of them were opportunists.

What is certain, however, is that based on historiographical research carried out in the past few decades, the issue can no longer be easily eliminated with the slogan of the wartime Polish government in exile, that Poland was simply a land without a Quisling . Especially in the beginning, when the Germans had not yet come to a final decision on what to do with the Polish territory, there were actually a number of candidates to fill in the position. As early as November 1939, Germans were soliciting a group of imprisoned Polish aristocrats to form a government. Similarly, they tried to persuade peasant leader Wincenty Witos to join them, but their proposals were always turned down. Michel Borwicz: L'occupant souhaitait-il un Quisling polonais?. Revue d'histoire de la deuxième guerre mondiale , 1963, No. 52, pp. 98–102 . The issue then became off topic for a while; however, after a few years, as the Reich was starting to lose the war, the Germans made a number of similar steps. They first discussed the search for a common anti-Communist and anti-Soviet platform with former Prime Minister Leon Kozłowski , later with the captured Home Army commander Stefan Grot Rowecki and finally, after the unsuccessful Warsaw Uprising, with Grot's successor Bór-Komorowski . All of them turned down the offers, although, true enough, even Hitler was against such arrangements. Nevertheless, Himmler's people and the Gestapo command continued their attempts to form ties with local divisions of the resistance movement in order to recruit them for the anti-Soviet fight. On the other hand, intiatives were also coming in from the Polish side. The most infamous was the offer of the pro-German Władysław Studnicki to command a totalitarian Polish state annexed to Germany. Tomasz Szarota : I Polacchi e il collaborazionismo. In: Fascismo e antifascismo. Rimozioni, revisioni, negazioni . Roma, Bari 2000, p. 164 . Later on, initiatives were also presented by various nationalist and Fascist Polish organizations such as Miecz i Pług.

While the issue was rather marginal for workers and peasants, it became much more critical for journalists, artists and bureaucrats. Researchers thus unanimously agree that the Przełom paper was fully collaborationist in character, which was, among other things, indicated by the fact that it began to be published only in Spring 1944. Szarota , Il collaborazionismo in un paese senza Quisling , pp. 406–407 . To a certain degree, the issue was also critical for scientists participating in the activities of the Krakow-based Institut für Deutsche Ostarbeit. In order to uphold patriotic behaviour, the resistance movement published a special moral code in 1941, describing crimes of treason, crimes against the Polish nation, ethical crimes and crimes against human dignity.

In any case, about 10,000 collaborationists were sentenced to death by the resistance movement, which maintained a genuine alternative Polish underground state. In this regard, the Polish police was suspicious as well. It remained on its position, had over 11,000 officers and was known as The Blue Police or Policja granatowa, as it was called in Polish. Although the police participated in the fight against the Warsaw ghetto uprising, it was otherwise full of confidantes of the resistance. Additionally, the Polish Criminal Police was active towards the end of the war, as were also the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police, the Jewish Ghetto Police and, last but not least, the so-called Trawniki men, who performed various guard duties in addition to suppressing the ghetto uprising. Neulen , An deutscher Seite , p. 300 . The participation of Poles in the Holocaust of the Jewish population and the Jewish collaboration within the ghettos are two further, related issues. With regard to anti-Semitism, its the Polish variation was supposedly different from the Nazi version, which originated in racism. The Polish anti-Semitism seemed to be based on economic competition and religious prejudice. Nevertheless, researchers have discovered that the rationale for some Polish groups attempting to form ties with the Nazis included a common ideological language of anti-Semitism.

In the beginning of 1943, both Governor Frank and later also Goebbels tried to change the policy towards Poles as well as Eastern peoples in general. Frank sent a memorandum regarding the issue to Hitler , but his proposal was rejected yet again. Goebbels' circular on the attitude of Germany towards European nations was written in a similar spirit, but Hitler still blocked the engagement of Poles and other nations despite having previously relented about the Soviet territories; he allowed the military participation of Poles only as late as autumn 1944.

The Germans instituted civilian administration and integrated the Baltic states with Belarus as districts of a special occupation zone called Reichskommissariat Ostland, which was headed by commissar Heinrich Lohse , who reported directly to the Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories Alfred Rosenberg . Although German authorities allowed the locals to organize a parallel autonomous administration (Selbstverwaltung), this institution merely had administrative and consulting powers. In Lithuania, the administration units were called General Councils, in Latvia they were named General Directorates and in Estonia they were known as Provincial Directorates.

It is namely a fact that the Balts owed absolutely nothing to the country they belonged to in 1941. Not only that, the still-vivid memories and unhealed wounds reinforced their anti-Russian and anti-Bolshevik feelings that became their main motivation for cooperation with the Nazis. This was also partly true for their participation in the Holocaust. Informal groups had already been exterminating Jews during war operations – the activities which later received support from the Nazis and were, therefore, intensified even further. In 1941 alone, over 100,000 Jews were killed, with only the Arajs Kommando killing 26,000. The anti-Semitism had roots in the old times, while those of more recent origin supposedly stemmed from the Soviet occupation and its policies which leaned heavily on the Jews. However, this was only part of the truth. Ibid., pp. 61–63 . The other motive for collaboration was a definitive pro-Nazi attitude, although there were few explicitly Fascist groups such as Thunder Crosses (Perkonkrusts) in Latvia.

The most famous of these units, and also the highest in numbers,, were the formal mobilization-based defensive battalions (Schutzmannschafts-Bataillone), which were followed by new mobilizations, such as the one in Autumn 1943. The response was poor, particularly in Lithuania, but it improved in the winter as Lithuania relegated the command over the local divisions to General Povilas Plechavičius . Latvia and Estonia continued to mobilize troops into ancillary police units and legions which the SS command intended to re-form into domestic Waffen-SS units. When this eventually took place, two divisions were formed in Latvia, i.e. the 15 th and 19 th Waffen-Grenadier-Divisions der SS, and one in Estonia, i.e. the 20 th Waffen-Grenadier-Division der SS (estn. Nr.1). Each numbered between 13,000 and 15,000 men. Despite different promises, the units were deployed to the Eastern Front and even elsewhere in Europe, rather than domestically and in the fight against partisans. In 1944, however, the front line again moved close to the Baltic countries and the fear of a renewed Soviet occupation spurred greater success in further mobilizations and calls to arms. This was particularly true in the case of Estonia, whose people felt the greatest threat. All together, as many as 70,000 Estonians, 110,000 Latvians, and 37,000 Lithuanians served in the German units. Estonians, in particular, fought tooth and nail against the charge of the Red Army.

{ "title": "Ideological Basis of Collaboration in Europe During World War II and a Short Comparison with Slovenia", "text": "The occupation regimes described above and the manifestations of their collaboration were typical of occupied territories that formed the core area of the Nazi invasion interests. Among other states, this area certainly also included Slovenia, or at least its northern parts. The subject is further treated below. However, we must first point to the already known fact that the Nazi Germany, and to a lesser extent also the other Axis powers, operated wildly different types of occupation regimes in its vast occupied territory, which were accompanied by different forms of collaboration development. Slovenia's surrounding area includes countries that, during World War II, suffered fates very different from the ones described above as well as from that of Slovenia. These countries are Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia and Italy. In the Fascist camp, all of them were considered independent countries, despite being more or less subordinate to the German Reich. Italy and Hungary were German allies, while Slovakia and Croatia were created as new vassal states. Hitler threatened Slovakia's leader Jozef Tiso with dividing Slovakia between the neighbouring countries and so practically forced him to declare independence, while the creation of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) can be ascribed to the nationalist potential of the Ustashe and the unresolved national question of Yugoslavia. However, both states were created in order to split up or demolish larger countries, i.e. Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. NDH was actually occupied from the very beginning, Slovakia and Germany from 1944, and Italy from the autumn of 1943. Before the occupation, Slovakia and Hungary were more or less autonomous, having only to satisfy the Nazi demands, which were generally related to the supply of goods in the case of Slovakia, and to military aid in the case of Hungary. By 1944, both countries had only partly satisfied the Nazi demands regarding the extradition and extermination of Jews. Italy and NDH had strong indigenous Fascist movements which resulted in great tragedies, particularly the racist version in Croatia. In Slovakia and Hungary, Fascist groups were weak and only became notable once the countries were occupied. Among these countries, Italy's case particularly stands out; it includes the fall of the Fascist state in the autumn of 1943, which was formed upon Hitler's mercy, having become the vassal Italian Social Republic headed by Hitler's idol Benito Mussolini . In the case of Croatia, we can speak of collaboration from the very beginning; in other countries, however, collaboration only started after the German occupation. Especially in Italy, where the new Republican Fascists did everything they could to help the occupying forces deal with the Italian resistance movement.

In the case of the Nazi occupation in Slovenian part of Styria (Štajerska), Upper Carniola (Gorenjska) and parts of Carynthia (Koroška), a number of parallels can be drawn regarding the situation in other occupied areas which the Nazis considered their core national territory and were thus the first in line to be annexed to the Reich. As we point out these parallels, we have practically already defined annexationism as the primary common characteristic. The only difference was that Germany annexed some of these areas in full, while Luxembourg, Alsace, a part of Lorraine and the Slovenian occupied territories were never formally annexed. However, there was practically no difference between both categories as these territories were annexed de facto. They were joined to the German (neighbouring) gaus, the authorities instituted labour schemes, military service and enforced German laws as well as administrative and political systems. The only detail that stood out was the population, which the racist Nazi authorities considered too immature to acquire German citizenships. In order to facilitate this, all these territories were subjected to active Germanization and tiered systems of citizenship were instituted, as well as formally voluntary membership in mass organizations. In this respect, the Steirischer Heimatbund in Štajerska and Kärtner Volksbund in Gorenjska can be compared to the Volksdeutsche Bewegung in Luxembourg, Deutsche Volksgemeinschaft in Alsace, and especially to the Deutsche Volksliste in Poland.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36292/ch08.html#p-226" },

{ "title": "Ideological Basis of Collaboration in Europe During World War II and a Short Comparison with Slovenia", "text": "Looking at the phenomenon and specific features of collaboration, the developments in Slovenia were not at all comparable to those in Belgium, where all forms of collaboration were present, with special emphasis on ideological collaboration and extremely strong volunteer SS units. To a certain degree, the situation in the Baltic area was similar; however, the main drive for mobilization there was the fear of Communism and the Soviet Union. To a certain extent, similarities can be observed with the development of collaboration in central Slovenia, primarily due to concerns about the possibility of a Communist takeover which could be anticipated from the actions of the Partisan movement under the Communist command. Unlike the situation in Belgium and, to a lesser extent, that in Luxembourg, the Baltic countries, and Poland, there was virtually no Fascist movement in Slovenia. It would be possible, however, to draw some weak parallels between Fascism and the so-called Rupnik circle during Rupnik's provincial administration in Ljubljana established after the capitulation of Italy. With regard to police and military form of collaboration, Slovenia and Belgium are again impossible to compare, with Belgium having been greatly influenced by the Flemish nationalism that acted as a trigger. While the situation was similar in the Baltic countries, in Slovenia the already mentioned key role in this respect was played by the fear of and resistance against Communism, i.e. a sort of counter-revolutionary drive. In the German-occupied Slovenian territory as at before 1943, collaboration was prominent among the German minority and the opportunistic part of the local population, which was reminiscent of the situation in Luxembourg, Alsace and Poland. As was the case in Poland, the Slovenian political and military collaboration with a Slovene national character was either not accepted by the Nazis or was considered unnecessary (with minor exceptions in Gorenjska occurring towards the end of the war). Similarly as elsewhere, there were Slovenes volunteering for the SS and Wehrmacht, although the numbers were limited. Looking at the big picture, it is clear that the situation in Slovenia can be compared to that in other countries, particularly those occupied and annexed to the Reich by the Nazis. However, Slovenia, which was, unlike other areas, initially occupied by three different powers, retains some of its original features.

Cultural autonomy was planned as well, with the Italians counting on a widespread cooperation of the Slovenian nation with the Fascist regime. On the other hand, all political parties were disbanded, while cultural, sports, charity and other non-political organizations and associations were generally incorporated into the Italian system. The Italians were also more tolerant towards the Slovenian press (which was, however, heavily censored) and the school system. Regarding the latter, numerous new ideas were implemented to gradually facilitate the incorporation of the Slovenian system of education into the Italian framework, and throughout the war, classes were conducted in Slovene. The Ljubljana university remained operational throughout the Italian occupation; starting with autumn 1943, however, it was only open to students who were there to take their exams. After the September 1943 capitulation of Italy, the Province of Ljubljana was occupied by the Germans who incorporated it into the newly formed operational zone called the Adriatic Littoral (Operationszone Adriatisches Küstenland).

Soon after the outbreak of World War II, scarcity and price gouging were felt by Slovenes as well. In the spring of 1940, their everyday lives were marked by first supply shortages, and autumn of the same year saw the introduction of the regulated economy: Decrees aimed at controlling the prices and stemming remorseless speculative trading were followed by a decree on meat conservation in May 1940. The decree dictated two days of the week, Tuesday and Friday, to be meatless days. On Tuesday and Friday, butchers were not allowed to sell meat and restaurants were not allowed to prepare or serve dishes that contained it. The authorities that drafted the decree were not completely heartless, however, as butcher's shops and restaurants still offered lamb and goat, poultry and venison throughout the week. In 1940, as the economic situation was becoming increasingly tense in spite of attempts to stabilize it, Ban Marko Natlačen issued a decree creating the Banate Institute of Food for Slovenia (Prevod), which was based in Ljubljana.

This rough draft of a mission description included the following obligations: keeping stock of supplies, procurement and control over distribution of the goods, and general rationing control. Prevod was authorized to monitor price movements and the work of salespeople as it was also in charge of fighting the black market. The Institute had to organize and execute supply campaigns in order to renew the stock of various comestibles in accordance with the decree on food reserves.

For months before that, Tamás and his fellow prisoners had suffered the impossible working conditions in the Jawischowits (Polish: Jawiszowice) coal mine, a branch of the infamous Auschwitz concentration camp. Tamás had arrived there from Prekmurje already on 21 May 1944, together with his mother, younger sister and other members of his family. On his arrival to Auschwitz-Birkenau, Tamás had lied about his age, claiming to be sixteen years old. Therefore the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele sent him to work, while his mother and little sister died in the gas chamber immediately as unfit for work.

Had the Allied Coalition not ultimately defeated the Nazi Germany, Tamás would have sooner or later become a victim of the colossal Nazi destruction machine. All of this just because he was Jewish. During World War II the Nazi Germany, with eager assistance of its allies, managed to eradicate two thirds (between five and six million) of Jewish people from the occupied Nazi Europe. In comparison with the pre-war Jewish population, more than 70 % of Jews in Poland, the Baltic region, Czechoslovakia, Greece and the Netherlands died, and only slightly less in the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. In contrast, in France, Bulgaria, Luxembourg and Italy around 20 % of the pre-war Jewish population died, which means that despite the severe persecution the majority lived to see the end of the war.

The Nazi delusions about a racially clean Reich, where only people of Arian descent could live, encouraged the Nazi elite to keep searching for new ways of removing Jews from the territories controlled by Germany. Since the Nazis rose to power in 1933 and until the breakout of World War II in 1939 the mass deportation of Jews from Germany was the only possibility for the final solution of the Jewish question. Hans Mommsen : Auschwitz, 17. Juli 1942. Der Weg zur europäischen Endlösung der Judenfrage . Munich, 2002, pp. 177–178 . With the implementation of increasingly radical anti-Jewish measures, Jews were gradually pushed out of the German society and economy completely. Many of them were thus forced to leave Germany. The German authorities literally forced Jews to emigrate, while at the same time the vast majority of their assets were confiscated. After the German annexation of Austria on 13 March 1938, Germany immediately started persecuting the Austrian Jews as well. In just a few months the Austrian Jews experienced all of the forms of persecution that the German Jews had been gradually subjected to in the years leading up to that point. Cf. Saul Friedländer : Das Dritte Reich und die Juden. Die Jahre der Verfolgung 1933–1939 . Munich, 2000 . Before that only around 270 Jews had lived in Carinthia, of these as many as 180 in Klagenfurt. The Nazi authorities exerted so much pressure against them that until the end of 1938 virtually all of them sold their property below cost and left Carinthia. Usually they were forced to leave for Vienna, where they waited for the opportunity to leave the German Reich. The majority of these people managed to leave in time, while the rest remained in the isolated houses, intended only for Jews, and awaited their destiny. At least 45 of them died in the Holocaust.

A very large number fled to Yugoslavia through Slovenia, where they mostly only stayed for a short time. Usually they headed on towards Zagreb immediately or in a day or two, and then towards other corners of Yugoslavia before finally retreating abroad. Many of these refugees were unable to keep travelling, though, and they got stuck in Yugoslavia for various lengths of time. With the aid of international Jewish organisations they were mostly taken care of by the Yugoslav Jewish religious congregations. Quite a few of these refugees were assigned to special shared accommodation.

As World War II began, the number of countries where Jews, unwanted in the German Reich, could seek refuge became increasingly slimmer. At the same time, with new victories of the German war machine, the number of Jews living in the territory of the expanded German Reich and in certain areas occupied by the Germans, especially in Poland, increased very rapidly as well. Even though the Nazi authorities continued to encourage the emigration of Jews from the German Reich until as late as 1941, such a solution of the Jewish question turned out to be increasingly unrealistic. The disenfranchised and destitute Jewish population gradually became concentrated and enclosed in ghettos. The plan was to deport and relocate them outside of the main territory of the German jurisdiction at the first suitable opportunity. However, every new plan with regard to the manner and location of their deportation (eastern Poland, Madagascar, polar regions of the Soviet Union) soon went up in smoke. In the circumstances of the ruthless German occupation policy, especially in Poland, the local Nazi rulers implemented progressively radical policies against Jews with the approval of their superiors.

Already before the war the German allies, one by one, swiftly adopted anti-Semitic legislation, drastically restricting the rights of the native Jews. Thus, after 1938, Italy and Hungary also restricted the Jewish citizens' rights and freedom of economic participation. Similarly as in Germany before, in Hungary and Italy the native Jews became more and more isolated. Thomas Schlemmer and Hans Woller : Der italienische Faschismus und die Juden 1922 bis 1945.

One of them restricted the enrolment of Jewish students in the universities, colleges, high schools, secondary schools, teachers' training colleges and other vocational schools. The number of Jewish pupils at these schools was supposed to be in line with the number of the Jewish population in the areas where these schools were located. The other decree prohibited Jews from establishing wholesale food dealerships, while the Jewish owners of the existing dealerships could be prohibited from further activities or forced to accept business management commissioners.

The chart above demonstrates the growing and diminishing number of the Jewish population in the Slovenian territory, occupied during World War II by the German, Italian and Hungarian occupiers. The largest number of Jews lived in Prekmurje, where they had begun to settle already in the 18 th century. Until the end of the 19 th century their number had already increased to 1000, but had diminished swiftly afterwards, especially due to their migration to larger city centres outside of the economically poorly-developed Prekmurje region. According to the last official population census in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, only 476 Jews were left in Prekmurje in 1931. The majority of them had been firmly rooted in this territory for several generations, and therefore almost all of them had Yugoslav citizenship. The Jewish community in the other parts of the Slovenian territory was completely different. As it happened, after the expulsion of Jews from Styria and Carinthia in 1497 and from Carniola in 1515 they were prohibited from permanently settling in this territory until as late as their emancipation in 1867. However, even afterwards Jews only rarely settled in these areas. Those who did were exceedingly urban, and the majority of them only settled there recently. In 1937 almost half of Jews were foreign citizens (from Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Germany and Romania). If they were Yugoslav citizens, almost half of them had only recently arrived from territories outside Slovenia as well, primarily from the neighbouring Croatia. Before World War II most Jews lived in the larger cities, especially Ljubljana, Maribor, Ptuj and Celje. Although they were, on average, significantly wealthier as the rest of the population and certain quite rich individuals were among them, the majority nevertheless belonged to the bourgeois middle class. It was also characteristic for these Jews that they were exceedingly mobile. During the 1931 census the interviewers only registered 344 Jews, but until the World War II their number gradually increased because of the refugees. Thus, together with Christianised Jews, approximately one thousand Jews lived in the territory of the Yugoslav Slovenia.

Thus he managed to barely avoid the mass arrests of all those individuals whom the occupiers saw as unfit to become full citizens of the German Reich. As it was, Lower Styria and Upper Carniola were among those occupied territories (like the western Poland, Alsace and Lorraine) that the Nazi elites wanted to Germanise as soon as possible. On their quest for the racially clean German Reich, the Germans wanted to drive out all of the racially inferior groups of the population and all those individuals they saw as obstacles to Germanisation due to national and political reasons. Not only did the Germans intend to banish the racially inferior Jews and Romani, but rather, primarily, the part of the non-German population that they did not intend to Germanise.

This was followed by systematic arrests, concentration of Jews in ghettos and their subsequent transportation to the concentration camps by the Germans. The Prekmurje Jews were among the first victims. In April 1944 the Hungarian authorities arrested 387 Jews, transported them through Čakovec to the temporary Jewish ghetto in Nagykanizsa, and from there to Auschwitz-Birkenau. On 20 October 1944 the few remaining Jews, who had been spared before, were arrested together with a large group of Slovenians.

However, with the occupation of Slovenia in April 1941 they started running towards Italy in increasingly large numbers. When this forced emigration came to an almost complete stop, the Jews from the Central and soon also Western Europe were gradually banished towards the east.

Swiftly – in just a few years – this model, implemented as worker's self-management in June 1950, became the foundation of the Yugoslav political system. After the initial enthusiasm, as the worker's self-management was an alternative to Stalin's model of socialism, its implementation became subject to disapproval. It turned out that the abandonment of the previous practices (especially centralism and the introduction of different relations between the republics and the federal government on the basis of the principle of payment according to one's work or managing the results of one's labour) called for changes. The opponents of self-management believed that this model may have demonstrated that socialism could be different from the Soviet system, but that in light of the normalisation of the relations with the Soviet Union after Stalin's death it was no longer necessary as a political tool for foreign affairs.

A Constitutional Act was adopted, but due to the introduction of self-management into the constitutional system it contained so many amendments it was in fact a new constitution. Self-management became the political foundation of the state system. The new constitution was more class-oriented. It referred to socialism instead of people's democracy, and the assembly of producers was introduced into the legislative bodies at all levels. Less attention was paid to the federal nature of the state organisation. The authors of the Constitutional Act referred to the united Yugoslav working class, which hinted at the possibility of national unitarianism and centralism. Placing the emphasis on the class for the purpose of self-management stirred awake the sleeping volcano: the national question. Due to the class aspect, the common Yugoslav awareness would supposedly be formed, pushing out the national aspect. Centralism as well as national unitarianism was a very tempting possibility for some, especially the Serbs. Such reasoning soon brought up the question of the role and position of the republics in the federation. At the same time, in view of the divergent economic development and economic situation, the question of the relations between the republics arose. It manifested itself through the relations between the developed and underdeveloped: in the issue of who benefitted more from the federation and who exploited whom in the economic sense. Because of the dissimilar outlooks on the role of the Yugoslav centre, the conflicts also became evident in the Yugoslav party-state leadership. Some of the Party leaders argued for the enhancement of self-management and decentralisation (among them Edvard Kardelj , the leading Slovenian politician in the Yugoslav Party and state leadership, author of constitutions and Party ideologist); while others argued for a stronger central authority and integration in all aspects (this opinion was represented by the Serbian politician Aleksandar Ranković , Party organisational secretary and head of the political police). The President of the State and General Secretary of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Josip Broz-Tito , leaned towards the centralist side. Two blocs formed: the federalists and centralists, or the developed and underdeveloped.

The communes were to assume certain functions of the state, and would function as the means for the withering of the state. Those who wanted to overcome the division of Yugoslavia into national republics saw the communes as a possibility for the abolishment of the national republics and transformation of Yugoslavia into a federation of communes. According to them, in this way the national principle of the federation would be abolished, allowing for the fusion into unitarian Yugoslavism. Certain hints with regard to the abolishment of the national republics were also stated at the 7 th Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in April 1958.

Much more – and in greater detail – was also said about the urgently needed reform of the federation. Kardelj spoke about this at the session of the Executive Committee of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (IK CK ZKJ) in November 1965 and suggested that the Yugoslav federation should be reformed by increasing the role of the republics.

However, the reform of the state organisation began. The Yugoslav federation was federalised as the jurisdictions of the republics increased. In the end of 1968 a few amendments were made to the Yugoslav constitution. These constitutional amendments primarily altered the structure and powers of the Federal Assembly as well as more precisely defined the autonomous provinces in the context of Serbia: Vojvodina and Kosovo. The Assembly of Nations – consisting of an equal number of deputies from each of the republics and half as many deputies from the two autonomous provinces – was introduced in the Federal Assembly. Thus outvoting on the basis of the republican adherence of the deputies would be prevented. In the middle of 1971, 23 additional amendments to the SFRJ Constitution, thus 42 altogether, were adopted, which means that the Constitution was thoroughly changed. The constitutional amendments also largely solved the crisis of federalism, which had been apparent already since the beginning of the 1960s and had also not been addressed by the 1963 Constitution. These federal amendments redefined the Yugoslav federation. Both autonomous provinces in the context of Serbia became constituent parts of the federal state. Republics were defined as states, founded on the sovereignty of the nations, which was an expression of a greater independence of the republics and their position in the federal state.

The 1974 Constitution – one of the longest in the world with its 406 articles – had a twofold character. On one hand it strengthened the federal nature of the state to such a degree that the critics of the constitutional system at the time (most of them were Serbian politicians) believed that this Constitution introduced a confederate Yugoslavia. Because the republics became states in the constitutional sense, supposedly Yugoslavia was no longer a federal state, but rather a union of states. On the other hand the new Constitution intensified the class-based elements of the Yugoslav society and state. Its main purpose was to address the question of classes in the Yugoslav society, as the class relations – the single Yugoslav working class – were supposedly the assurance for the state community, its unity and its existence in general. Therefore the Constitution placed considerable emphasis on self-management and the so-called associated labour, which was the name for the integration of free producers (the working class) at all levels – from labour organisation to the state level. The so-called delegate system was introduced with the aim of ensuring that the representative bodies did not consist of elected professionals, or permanent Members of the Assembly. This would supposedly de-professionalise politics and hand it over to the citizens. Classic elections were abolished due to the conviction that they resembled parliamentary elections too closely. In the delegate system everything was based on elected delegates, who then went on to elect (from their own ranks) the delegates for the higher levels, up to the Federal Assembly. The delegate of delegates was at the top. In the second half of the 1970s, when the delegate system became fully functional, around 200,000 people in Slovenia – more than one tenth of the population or every fourth employee – were involved in delegations at various levels. The functioning of the delegate Assembly system turned out to be complicated, expensive, as well as inefficient. In practice it became apparent that the decisions, adopted by the delegates, were, as a rule, first agreed upon in the League of Communists. The new Constitution in fact represented a victory of the conservative forces in the Yugoslav state and Party leadership. The federalisation of the federation was seen as confederalisation in Serbia, for example. It is also what the Serbian national ideologue, writer Dobrica Ćosić , thought already in 1962, when he saw self-management and the enhancement of federalism by increasing the role and position of the republics in comparison with the centre as the disintegration of Yugoslavia.

One notable fact of this discussion is that the border Kardelj indicated as the one masses would interpret as the result of extreme concessions given to Italy was the demarcation line, which was actually implemented in 1954 with only minor adjustments. The official Yugoslav explanation claimed that such a proposal was favourable to Italy as the annexed territory would have contained more Yugoslavs (about 48,000) than Yugoslavia Italians (about 29,000). However, looking at the ethnic shares of the minorities, Italy would be home to about 50,000 Slovenes more than Yugoslavia would be home to Italians. The Yugoslav negotiators submitted data indicating that the 1910 census of the area annexed to Yugoslavia in 1947 found 114,076 Italians living there, the 1948 census found 67,856 and the 1951 census found about 40,000. According to the Yugoslav government, the number of Italians dropped dramatically due to the voluntary emigration of 114,000 Italians (over 30,000 in 1948 alone). The emigration supposedly confirmed that the Italians living there were not an indigenous ethnic element attached to this place, but, rather, immigrants.

Its Commission for the Relations between Nations and Republics prepared an expert analysis entitled Several Issues of Relations between Nations in the Yugoslav People's Army based on the data collected until 1967. The analysis stated that the below-average share of Slovenians among officers was problematic. Approximately two thirds of Slovenian officers had been promoted to their rank already during the war and would fulfil retirement conditions in the following years. In order to replace them and match the share of Slovenian officers with the share of Slovenian citizens in Yugoslavia, approximately 1500 officers had to be trained in the next few years. Nevertheless, since 1961 only 106 candidates from Slovenia had been admitted to military schools, and after 1964 less than ten Slovenians per year enrolled in these schools. In order to balance their numbers with the national structure in Yugoslavia, at least 200 Slovenians per year should enrol in military schools. Consequently the share of Slovenians (and members of other smaller nations) among officers decreased, while the share of the largest nation swiftly increased: Without any intention to discuss the actions, undertaken or planned by the Army to draw applicants to military schools, it is a fact that these actions have not been successful so far, at least not in Slovenia. It is a well-known fact that among the officers from the war 25 % are Serbian, while their share amounts to as much as 65 % of the total number of the post-war officers in the Yugoslav People's Army. In their search for potential causes, the authors of the expert analysis drew the attention to different problems. In line with the preceding official doctrine they unexpectedly wrote: The language issue, at least as far as the language of command in the Army is concerned, is not problematic.

This approach stemmed from the position that language equality had always been a part of Slovenian political demands; that Slovenian language was especially threatened during the occupation in World War II; and that the demands for the equality of mother tongue were the very motive for joining the Partisan ranks for many Slovenians who were favourably inclined towards a federal transformation of the state. One of the proofs of Slovenian statehood (sovereignty) is the establishment of Slovenian command in the Partisan and regular units of the Slovenian Liberation Army. At that time, Slovenian language was used exclusively in all Slovenian military units, Ibid., p. 97 . wrote Avšič and added that this was also the only possible way. In his opinion, one of the reasons for the rapid downfall of the First Yugoslavia's Army was that it was detested, because officers and junior officers despised people of non-Serbian nations and languages, Ibid., p. 98 . and it failed to recognise languages of a large part of its citizens, which accounted for the lack of patriotism and combat preparedness. Avšič's approach was convincing and well-argued since it was based on primary sources to describe the development of the national and language policy in the Communist Party before the war and in the Partisan units. The mother tongue, i.e. Slovenian, was soon being used consistently in these units in the Slovenian territory, although men with experience from the Yugoslav or even the old Austrian Army and the Spanish Civil War were among the officers.

Subsequently he provided a detailed and substantiated explanation of the eighteen introductory theses. His attitude towards the language of command was completely clear: The claim that modern warfare demands one language of command cannot withstand critical analysis. The equality of languages of the Yugoslav nations would enhance the capability and fighting efficiency of the Army. The speed of executing the actions is not affected by using the languages of the nations. Ibid., p. 1 . Instead of obliging the majority to learn a foreign language, the same could be expected of the commanding minority: Only officers should learn the required language and the team could be given commands in their mother tongue. Contrary to the official name – Serbo-Croatian or Croatian-Serbian language – he occasionally used the expression Serbian language, indirectly pointing to the privileged position of one nation with regard to military matters: By using one language – Serbian – only formal, superficial unity is achieved. The Yugoslav People's Army needs a substantive unity, which can only benefit from using the mother tongue. Historical experiences with imposing the use of one language were too painful, mentioned Avšič , and harshly criticised the policy of perpetuating the old patterns: The motives of certain people who argue for maintaining one language are centralist and unitarian in their nature and point to a lag in the society's development. Ibid., p. 2 . He believed that nationally homogenous military units could also be assigned in the exterritorial manner, and especially that officers should learn the language of their soldiers. In Avšič's opinion, the opposition against introducing language equality also stemmed from the fact that officers currently speak only one language – Serbo-Croatian. He concluded the contribution by severely criticising officers: Is seems that they are not able to fathom how smooth the transition to language equality would be, if only the system of manning the units would be changed. What seems to prevail is some kind of incomprehensible mentality about the inequality of nations and the entitlement of the Serbian language and people to privileges.

Therefore next month, in June 1969, he also sent around a supplement or the so-called Drugi del pripomb k mnenjem o rabi jezikov v JLA (The Second Part of the Comments on the Opinions about the Use of Languages in the Yugoslav People's Army). In these comments he already explicitly referred to the federal resolution on the use of languages. He argued for the territorial allocation of conscripts in the vicinity of their home, in the nationally-uniform military units where the language of command would be their mother tongue. The potential lack of officers, proficient in military expressions in the mother tongue, would be resolved with additional measures, while military schools would introduce lessons in the languages of different Yugoslav nations in order to also attract more nationally-diverse candidates.

For example, in March 1970 the Delo newspaper refused to publish his response to the article where the official information about the radical shortage of Slovenians among the Yugoslav People's Army officer staff was published for the first time. Avšič's opinions with regard to this issue were only published in July 1971 in the Sodobnost magazine. Once again he underlined the extreme importance of the mother tongue when it came to choosing the military profession: Enough high-quality personnel existed for the Slovenian units until the very end of the war as well as in 1945 in the central institutions. Then the number of Slovenians started decreasing. When the Slovenian units were abolished, reassigned to every location, and the Army started using the Serbo-Croatian language, Slovenians lost their enthusiasm to serve in the military units.

He was most direct and stern, and certain other Slovenian intellectuals joined him in his criticism as well. In the autumn of 1970, psychologist Janez Rugelj mentioned the issue of language as one of the key factors of the poor relations as well as the discontent of senior staff and soldiers with regard to their position in the Yugoslav People's Army.

Rugelj rejected the imputations and referred to the findings in Avšič's articles and statements of certain politicians from the ranks of the so-called Party liberals from Croatia and Serbia, who supported the demands for a greater equality of languages in all aspects of human activities. He reiterated the standpoint, already noticeable in Avšič's articles, that the reproaches with regard to the insinuated demands for republican or national armies were fabrications, and that nobody demanded any republican and national armies, but only the unification of fighters of the same nationalities in the basic units (companies, battalions, etc.), which can also be deployed exterritorially if needed.

For the first time the discussions mentioned the fates of the Slovenian officers who had completely lost every contact with their native environment and mother tongue due to the years of working in the Yugoslav People's Army. When he familiarised himself with such stories, in the end of 1970 the poet Ciril Zlobec wrote that the stories had shaken him and that he, as a Partisan in the Slovenian Littoral, could only be thankful that he barely managed not to stay in the Army.

Slovenian politics familiarised itself with these positions, information and argumentation, and used it to formulate its own standpoints.

In December 1969 State Secretary Colonel General Nikola Ljubičić ordered that the competent state and military institutions should draw up analyses and compile the necessary information, which they obviously did not have at their disposal yet, and study the issue of languages from the viewpoint of peacetime and wartime circumstances before finally sending their findings to the competent authorities at the State Secretariat. SI AS 1589, IV, box 189, 435, Ukaz ( Nikola Ljubičić , 26 December 1969) . Thus the military leadership should have information on the use of languages and alphabets in all military matters at its disposal in 1970. As far as the education of officer staff was concerned, attention should be paid to the need and possibilities of learning the Slovenian and Macedonian languages in the military schools as well as to the organisation of language courses for officers, where the basics of other languages would be taught. Additionally, it should also be stated what realistic obstacles may prevent the achievement of the complete equality of languages and alphabets.

The majority of the analysis regarding the ways of ensuring the equality of languages in the military would supposedly be complete in 1970, and other proposals for changes should also be outlined. The order refrained from revealing any concrete information, but as far as the demands for the increased equality of the Slovenian and Macedonian languages were concerned it was usually stated that the needs and possibilities in that regard should be explored.

Senior officers would not be obliged to learn the languages of their surroundings. However, they would be encouraged to do it with a system of rewards, and in so far as possible the written letters of certain bodies would be responded to in the language of the original letter. However, most of the training, command and coordination activities in the Yugoslav People's Army were listed as tasks where the use of a single language would not be possible to avoid. The national languages, aside from the uniform language could only be used in the units dominated by soldiers of a single nationality. Furthermore, this principle was also applied in the territorial defence, the elaboration of the Ministry of Defence stated. Already the use of the term uniform language, which Yugoslavia had never known, indirectly indicated that the military leadership did not possess much understanding for the demands for a greater equality of languages in the Army. The argument used by the State Secretariat for People's Defence to support the need for the use of Serbo-Croatian language was misleading as well. The competent authorities stated the following fact as the reason for this: that 90 % of all senior officers currently employed in the Yugoslav People's Army belong to the nations speaking Serbo-Croatian.

At least a hint of the good will of the military leadership was displayed in the plan signed in January 1970 by Colonel General Ivan Dolničar , the Slovenian Assistant State Secretary of People's Defence at the time. The plan mostly listed what should be analysed, how soon it should be studied, and in what cases a greater equality of languages in the operations of the Yugoslav People's Army could be implemented.

As the republican leaderships from the ranks of Party liberals were replaced one after the other by the communists from the older, more dogmatic generation, the willingness to embrace changes disappeared. The wheels of Yugoslav politics turned in the opposite direction, back to the time when open debates and controversial ideas were pushed into the realm of private affairs. To prevent this from happening after all, Jaka Avšič kept sending letters tenaciously, reiterating and additionally elaborating on the viewpoints he had presented publicly in numerous published contributions. When the discussion about the proposed amendments of the People's Defence Act took place, Avšič wrote to the Presidency of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, President Josip Broz Tito and Edvard Kardelj in the end of 1972, suggesting that the article on the privileged position of one of the languages be deleted from the legislation.

The promise of the Supreme Commander, Avšič continued, was spread among Slovenian fighters, who accepted this as a natural right that they were entitled to.

{ "title": "The Civil Repressive Apparatus of the Second Yugoslavia and Its Perception Among the Slovenian Public", "text": "Repression is an old expression denoting measures that are arising from legislation or are justified by a state of emergency (reprisals), meaning to crush or restrain. In the 1960s, the term was used by Marcuse Herbert Marcuse (1898–1979), German philosopher, sociologist and political theorist. who used it to denote all kinds of national, public and private control, and by the late 1960s, repression had become the general term for all types of oppression or suppression of the people . This definition opens the report on the project entitled Javno mnenje in represija ( Public Opinion and Repression ) authored by Katja Vodopivec and published in the Revija za kriminalistiko in kriminologijo magazine in 1991. The subject framework of the term repression namely encompasses a number of different concepts, with the modern understanding including a situation that is stressful to the individual and drives them towards the margins of the society by attacking them, their property and freedom, their opportunities to work and be creative, their national affiliation and their social status. Katja Vodopivec : Javno mnenje in represija [Public Opinion and Repression]. Revija za kriminalistiko in kriminologijo , 1991, No. 42, p. 206 . However, the broad spectrum implied by this definition is usually limited to various forms of state repression, the common belief regarding which is that the Slovenian society became truly aware of them in the 1980s, during the time of democratization and the initial phases of Slovenia's breakaway from the greater repressive homeland. The term repression has a negative connotation, and, over the last few decades, state repression, which has remained ubiquitous even to this day, was often confused with political repression. It is a fact, however, that both forms of repression did exist in a kind of symbiosis in former Yugoslavia. In Slovenia, the last three years of the 1980s were defined by the anticipation of a transformation of the social system. This was a period when Slovenes worked to reduce political repression, a time when we were increasingly raising our voices against repression of any kind. We were claiming to be the least repressive nation of Yugoslavia. It made sense to verify these claims and beliefs.

Most of the survey respondents believed that this was the responsibility of the state. Ibid., p. 207 . The dilemmas faced by Slovenes in the 1980s regarding the perception of the operation of the rule of law were not significantly different from the ones we face today. For a definition of value systems in Slovenia, see: Blaž Babič : Politična tranzicija in vprašanje vrednostnih sistemov pri Slovencih po letu 1990 [Political Transition and the Question of the Value Systems of Slovenians after 1990].

However, people increasingly think that it should not be the responsibility of the military (in 1982: 10 %; in 1988: 18 %; in 1989: 42 %), but rather that order within the country should be kept by the police. More and more people believe that Slovenia is paying too much for the armament and maintenance of the Yugoslav People's Army (JLA) (1989: 64 %). However, as late as 1989/1990, the share of people agreeing that the military system should protect the political system and order in the country was equal (42 %) to the share of those who disagreed with this thought. The Slovenes had a much better opinion of the police, with as much as two thirds of respondents supporting its work, although the percentage of those who believed that the Militia was on the side of the government rather than on the side of the people was a bit higher. According to the survey results, people were generally unaware of the infringement of individuals' rights and liberties as one third of the respondents were quite happy to acquiesce to telephone tapping and one quarter of them agreed with the police arresting and questioning their compatriots on the basis of anonymous reports. Surprisingly, the replies thus show a tendency towards increasingly harsh punishments, with opposition to the punishment of verbal offences against the political system Pursuant to the provisions of Article 133 of the Penal Code of SFRJ. See: Uradni list SFRJ , No. 44/76; No. 34/84; No. 74/87; No. 57/89; No. 3/90; No. 38/90 . and opposition to the death penalty being two significant exceptions. The two exceptions were almost surely the result of an extensive media campaign A group of Slovenian intellectuals made a public appeal to the Federal Assembly to abolish the death penalty as early as 1983, and an avalanche of similar demands broke out after the initiative was published by the Mladina magazine. Formally, the death penalty was abolished with the constitutional changes of 1989. See: Blaž Vurnik : Med Marxom in punkom. Vloga Zveze socialistične mladine Slovenije pri demokratizaciji Slovenije [Between Marx and Punk Music. Role of the Socialist Youth League of Slovenia in the Democratisation of Slovenia]. Ljubljana, 2005, p. 31 . in the late 1980s in addition to the people also becoming increasingly critical of who the punishment was meted out to. The attitude of the Slovenian society towards the death penalty was also quite unique. If the first six years after the war, a time when politics ruled over the law, over 200 death sentences were passed, mostly in political trials, 218, to be precise. See: Spisek obsojenih oseb, nad katerimi je bila izvršena smrtna kazen v času od 1945 do 31. December 1952. Digitalized document from the Archives of the Republic of Slovenia, SI AS 1931. Available at: http://www.arhiv.gov.si/fileadmin/arhiv.gov.si/pageuploads/SDV_2014/Spisek_obsojeni/AS_1931_1067_Obsojeni.pdf . but such sentences were no longer pronounced after 1951 (in Yugoslavia after 1954), exclusively for political reasons. Until the formal abolishment of the death penalty that followed the constitutional changes of 1989 (when the last death sentence in Yugoslavia was executed in Titograd), the death sentence was pronounced 12 more times – of course only for serious criminal offences – and the last person was executed in 1959. The public opinion turned against capital punishment as early as 1963, when such sentence was the subject of a series of articles written by Slovenian intellectuals and published by the Perspektive magazine. The intellectuals were upset by a death sentence given to a Bosnian worker for manslaughter as most other cases, with Slovenian defendants, would never conclude with such a harsh punishment. However, just like today, not everybody was convinced, and a survey carried out by the 7D weekly in 1975 showed that 5 out of 7 respondents would have preferred to keep the death penalty in the Penal Code. Andrej Studen : Rabljev zamah [Executioner's Blow]. Ljubljana, 2004, pp. 120–122 . After 1980, the public opinion was increasingly shaped by accessible literature, both scientific and fictional, which treated the impact of the illegal acts occurring in the first few years of the Yugoslavian state. Over one half of all respondents of a survey conducted in the late 1980s believed that human rights were adequately protected in Yugoslavia, but nevertheless thought that the courts were not impartial. The respondents even believed that political dissidents should be allowed to publish articles in newspapers (61 %), organize public gatherings (57 %), publish books expressing their views (56 %) and establish political parties (46 %). Vodopivec , Javno mnenje in represija, pp. 207–208 . According to these findings, the Slovenian experiences with the repressive apparatus of the second Yugoslavia were mixed, and this paper attempts to trace them based on a review of the operation of some parts of the apparatus of state repression. It is clear that general modernization of the society should also be included among reasons for the declining aggressiveness of the country's repressive apparatus towards its citizens. The latter were in continuous contact with the repressive apparatus, even if only through the contact with a policeman directing the traffic.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36298/ch14.html#p-381" },

Since some of the constituent parts of state administration have a much more repressive character, this paper focuses on them. The topic is thus broken down into three segments, which were analysed in detail, namely the judiciary, intelligence and security services and police bodies. In light of the definition given above and considering today's understanding of the period in question, however, the category could be expanded to include other services as well. And if I had mentioned that my wish is to understand the context inhabited by ordinary citizens, it should also be pointed out that I was, unfortunately, unable to pay due attention to the one repressive body of the state that probably caused the most undue stress among the citizens of socialist Slovenia. The body in question was not controlled by the government of the republic but was rather under federal control, and reactions to it were similar to today's reactions to any reference made to the Tax Administration. I'm referring to the Customs Administration, which was encountered by most citizens at least a few times per year as they were travelling abroad with their meagre handfuls of foreign currency they managed to save.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36298/ch14.html#p-382" },

Although the decentralization process that was being carried out for most of the time during the second Yugoslavia resulted in a gradually increasing independence of all these bodies, federal legislation in these areas had a profound impact on the newly drafted legislations at the level of individual republics, inhibiting the development of notable particularities. Nevertheless, at the time of severe constitutional changes and increasingly liberal tendencies emerging in the governments of respective republics, the Yugoslav leadership always clearly maintained that certain sectors had to remain under federal control. I have to say that I do not agree with the regional communist inclinations.

In his response to Tito's speech entitled Unity of the Federation Requires the Creation of an Authoritative Body ( Enotnost federacije terja ustanovitev avtoritativnega telesa ), which he held in Zagreb in 1970, Milentije Popović had the following to say at the October 1970 session of the Executive Bureau of the Presidium of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (ZKJ): I agree that the system has to develop from the bottom up, starting with the commune, as had been explained. I will not repeat this. Let me just list the things I believe should be resolved by the same Act, by the Constitution. First of all, the relations between the federation and the republics, i.e. the responsibilities of the federation and the federation – republics relations . Although I am stating this as two items, as these two things are and are not the same, it remains of the utmost importance to clearly determine the responsibilities of the federation. In this regard, we have to be perfectly clear on the concepts we are using and determine these with the Constitution, starting from the issues indicated by comrade Kardelj and proceeding in accordance with agreements we had actually already come to at some of our previous sessions. First of all, it has to be clear what the federation's responsibilities are regarding national defence, and particularly how these responsibilities are to be fulfilled. I am saying this as it is clear that, when we speak of these matters, we are fixing them for the time when comrade Tito will no longer be the President of the Republic or our supreme commander. With regard to some things that seem perfectly clear today as they were shaped by our revolutionary history, we will have to agree on the relations that would be used in these areas in the future of the collective presidency.

{ "title": "The Civil Repressive Apparatus of the Second Yugoslavia and Its Perception Among the Slovenian Public", "text": "The role of repressive bodies and their independence at the level of individual republics was changed via frequent constitutional amendments that were frequently adopted in Yugoslavia as the country tried to establish a new social order that would follow the general ground rules typical of socialist countries while at the same time trying to distance itself from such rules, seeking conceptual support in the forms that were alleged to inspire the original Marxist ideology Zdenko Čepič : Načela in počela socialistične demokracije [Principles and Origins of Socialist Democracy]. Prispevki za novejšo zgodovino , 2011, No. 1, p. 282 . and thus to justify its internal policy. The process of decentralization culminated in the 1974 constitution that gave the republics as well as autonomous provinces a large degree of independence along with the hope that the Yugoslav national question would finally be taken off the agenda once and for all. Accordingly, the role of the governments of individual republics became more important as these bodies played a decisive role in various areas, while others remained the responsibility of the federal government. Nevertheless, centralist tendencies remained present in the background, and although they suffered a serious blow after 1966, they recovered in the mid-1980s, particularly in Serbia, which significantly contributed to the popularity of the Slovenian policy which defended what had been, in terms of decentralization, obtained in the past and bolstered it even further, and which ultimately, in combination with other circumstances, resulted in Slovenia declaring its independence. By transferring a relatively major part of the jurisdiction over various repressive bodies to the governments of individual republics, these achieved a higher level of sovereignty which was, towards the end of the period in question, particularly pronounced in Slovenia due to the its specific political and economic development as well as its ethnic homogeneity. The creation of the Territorial Defence thus allowed the Slovenian Armed Forces to be established relatively quickly, despite various complications due to the attempts by federal and military authorities to interfere just prior to the break up of Yugoslavia, while independent police and intelligence apparatuses allowed the country to control its borders and territory. The broad jurisdiction of the republic in this area thus allowed for a result that would probably have been impossible in a federation with a more centralist structure as the whole repressive apparatus, except for most of the armed forces, was controlled by the republic.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36298/ch14.html#p-384" },

{ "title": "Public Security", "text": "In the area of public security, the powers of individual republics significantly expanded over time. If the initial phases of development of the Yugoslav government system saw the public security to be dictated by Belgrade, then notwithstanding the fact that such bodies formally existed in all republics, the influence of the republics greatly increased with time and was an important factor in the 1980s with the political upheavals. The People's Militia, consolidated into a single organization in 1946, By that time, the Militia operated in accordance with the Slovenian experience. – Pavle Čelik : Povezanost postaj naših varnostnih sil z lokalnimi skupnostmi (1850–2010) [Connections between the Stations of our Security Forces with the Local Communities (1850–2010)]. Revija za kriminologijo in kriminalistiko , 2010, No. 2, p. 209 . was the most ubiquitous public security service, which operated by the Soviet example and retained a number of military features that were gradually phased out after 1956, as the Militia turned to Western models and formed connections with people and local environments. Although an act passed in 1956 put the Militia under a unified internal affairs administration, it also placed significant emphasis on the municipal bodies, so that the institutions of local self-government played an important part in the provision of public security in its territories. Prior to 1956, the public order was, in addition to the general People's Militia, also kept by specialized firemen's, forest, traffic and ancillary militias. If needed, the ancillary militia could be drafted from amongst military conscripts. – Ibid., p. 209 . A significant new feature was introduced by the Internal Affairs Service Act from 1964, which stipulated that the operation of public security services was to be public, as it remains today. After 1967, almost entire control over the internal affairs authorities passed to individual republics, while, formally and legally, the transfer was made final by the republics' internal affairs act of 1973. However, the most important advance in the sovereignty of individual republics was the transfer of jurisdiction from the border police working at all types of border crossings, even the international ones, to individual republics. This affected about a third of all militiamen, who were subsequently trained at the Tacen academy. The national border surveillance remained under the jurisdiction of federal authorities since it was the responsibility of the military, as was also the case with the customs service. Among other things, the act of 1967 formally greatly limited the use of physical violence and particularly of firearms in police work, allowing militiamen the use of firearms against fleeing suspects only if the minimum sentence for the criminal offence a suspect had allegedly committed was longer than 15 years. In spite of the decreasingly repressive character of internal affairs authorities, the data from crime statistics allow us to conclude that the ominous headlines that accompanied it ( After Some Years, Criminal Offences on the Increase in Slovenia etc.) did not reflect the facts. From 1958 to 1979, the number of recorded criminal offences thus fluctuated between approx. 18,000 and 28,000, and the drastic changes were usually the result of amendments to criminal laws and general shifts in the society. One such shift occurred in the openness of state borders for travellers or individuals working abroad. Starting with the amending act of 1959, which limited the prosecution of criminal offences under Article 303 (illegal crossing of state borders; formerly every such crossing, changed to violent crossings only), commentators note a drastic decrease in the number of such offences, from thousands recorded in the 1950s to a couple of hundreds, and the decrease is further supported by, e.g., the elimination of criminal complaints due to injuries sustained in fistfights, which were subsequently generally resolved in civil proceedings. Furthermore, these changes resulted in a significant decrease in the use of detention on remand, which was gradually excluded from the conventional investigation procedure. Additionally, in the mid-1950s, slightly more than half of all individuals detained infringed the Article 303. The somewhat incomplete statistics (1951 and 1952 are missing) tell us that 77,778 individuals were apprehended at the Slovenian state border between 1947 and 1962. Pavle Čelik : Stražarji državne meje v Sloveniji (1918–2013) [State Border Guard in Slovenia (1918–2013)]. Ljubljana, 2013, p. 223 . Naturally, the social development determined which reports would fill the crime statistics much the same as they do today, and we can see a gradual increase of criminal offences against property, which were, at the same time, among the least frequently resolved cases. From 25 % to 30 % of all criminal cases, mostly thefts, remained unsolved, and the number of sex crimes was on a sharp increase as well; two reasons stated by analysts are the isolation of foreign labourers in segregated neighbourhoods and the women's intention to obtain the legal right to have an abortion , but the increase was probably also the result of greater awareness raised among the population. While the comparatively low numbers of criminal offences (taking into account the specifics of the time: the homosexual population was prosecuted, abortions were illegal etc.) could be attributed to the ubiquity of the state repressive apparatus, it is more probable that it was also the reflection of the Slovenian social situation.

{ "title": "State Security", "text": "Today, the operation and misuse of intelligence and security services is considered the most questionable aspect of state repression. The existence and operation of security and intelligence services represents a fundamental aspect of state repressive bodies and a significant element of the state's security system. In its essence, the aim of intelligence and security services was to collect, process and analyse data pertinent to state security and the country's economic and political relations with other countries. However, from the fundamental objectives delineated above, i.e. from operating against other countries, For details on this aspect of Yugoslav security operations, see: Antun Duhaček : Ispovest obaveštajca – Uspon i pad jugoslovenske obaveštajne službe . Belgrade, 1992 . intelligence activities soon developed and started being carried out on domestic territory as well, initially as counter-intelligence operations against foreign intelligence services, but then also as the broad network typical of socialist or rather single-party/totalitarian countries and used to control internal opposition. The Yugoslav security-intelligence system originated from the Soviet system of intelligence services, which were intertwined with all areas of life The considerable penetration of the security apparatus can be well illustrated by the special consolidated records of the National Internal Affairs Secretariat of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, which has been published on the web and contains data collected by the state and public security services on over a million of SFRJ citizens and foreigners who were monitored by these agencies. Available at: www.cae.udba.net . and had close connections with the rest of the repressive apparatus. In socialist countries, it was common for the security and intelligence services to have their own security forces, either a military or a police one. Initially, this was the case in Yugoslavia too; however, the reach of security and intelligence services, which radically increased after World War II, was later subject to significant limitations. Despite the obvious extensiveness of the security-intelligence network, it can be said that the operation of security and intelligence services progressed in accordance with the somewhat more liberal approach to the social system typical of Yugoslavia, when compared to other countries of what was, at the time, the Eastern Bloc. In democratically organized social systems, the operation of security and intelligence services is controlled by the government and the parliament; however, this is simply not possible in single-party political systems, and so in the Yugoslav case, the state security services were part of this system and thus under the jurisdiction of the Communist Party, i.e. the political leaders of the country. As put succinctly by Peter Volasko during the time of the second Yugoslavia, an assessment of the totalitarianism among the security services is obstructed by the temporal and spatial reality of the Yugoslav experiment: Every phenomenon carries contradictions and opposites, and this is true of socialism in the SFRJ as well. However, we must first decide whether to study it 'per se' or in constellation with other, related and unrelated systems. Peter Volasko : Ordine nuovo.

{ "title": "State Security", "text": "The creation of a unified Yugoslav intelligence service was based on events that occurred during World War II. As early as 1941, the Slovenian resistance movement established the Security-Intelligence Service of the Liberation Front (VOS OF), which then underwent a slight reorganization based on the 1942 orders from the Supreme Command of the National Liberation Army and the Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (NOV and POJ) and was thus coordinated within the policies of the pan-Yugoslav resistance movement. A fully unified and centrally controlled security and intelligence service was established with the creation of the Department for the Protection of the People (Serbian: Odeljenje za zaštitu naroda, resulting in the OZNA acronym) on 13 May 1944 as part of the Yugoslav Army. The OZNA comprised four sections: Section 1 was in charge of intelligence data from abroad, Section 2 carried out intelligence operations in the occupied territory, Section 3 carried out counter-intelligence in the Army, and Section 4 took care of records and statistics. Ljuba Dornik Šubelj : Varnostno-obveščevalna služba [Security Intelligence Service]. In: Enciklopedija Slovenije [Encyclopedia of Slovenia], 14 . Ljubljana, 2000, p. 141 . The OZNA was initially headed by one of Tito's closest colleagues, Aleksandar Ranković – Marko , who remained at the helm of the Yugoslav repressive apparatus until 1966. In August of the same year, People's Defence Corps of Yugoslavia was established (Serbian: Korpus narodne odbrane Jugoslavije – KNOJ), an independent security-intelligence body in liberated parts of Yugoslavia that also functioned as the executive body of OZNA.

The service retained the military structure and operated in such a way until 1952. In March 1946, Section 3, In practice, the military counter-intelligence service operated independently since 1945. which was in charge of counter-intelligence operations in the army, was formally detached from UDV, splitting the Yugoslav security and intelligence service into two pillars or spheres, the civilian sphere and the military sphere. Until its incorporation in the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army in March 1948, Section 3 operated independently and was given a new name that remained in use, despite the abrupt change, until the end of the second Yugoslavia: Counter-intelligence Service or also KOS. In 1955, the name of KOS was changed to Security Bodies (Serbian: Organi bezbednosti – OB) of the JLA and the service became part of the Federal Secretariat of People's Defence. The operation of the Security Bodies was centralized, with the service then subdivided according to military areas, its members serving in all units of the Yugoslav People's Army (JLA) Informants of the secret service were everywhere .

{ "title": "State Security", "text": "A lot is known about the operation of the Yugoslav security-intelligence system in this period, and we can thus say that it was organized in accordance with the Soviet principles This, however, is disputed by General Marijan F. Krajnc (his last function before retirement was Head of the Security Department of Army Area 9), who claims that the Soviet influence was direct only up to the Cominform split, with echoes remaining detectable until General Mišković stepped down as Head of the Military Counterintelligence Service (1971), and that the intelligence methods used (though Krajnc is discussing counter-intelligence) mostly followed the British, German and Czech examples. See: Kranjc , Bistveni ugovori, pp. 162–163. and that its nature was reinforced by the sensitive security situation and political instability that were the result of World War II. However, before the operations were even concluded – in some cases, the pursuit aimed against members of the armed groups that opposed the regime lasted until the early 1950s, while some state borders were questionable even after that – the services received a new blow, i.e. the Cominform Resolution of June 1948. The Yugoslav internal and foreign policies, which had exhibited some notably Eastern tendencies, was now facing a conflict with former friends and mentors, resulting in an even greater need for decisive action on the part of the security and intelligence service, who could no longer only focus on operations against Western adversaries, hostile and extremist emigrant organizations and remnants of the internal bourgeois opposition, but was forced to find enemies even amongst its own circles. After the years immediately following the Cominform Resolution, during which the Yugoslav government tried to be holier than the Pope by rapidly adopting the Soviet patterns, intense contacts with the previously hated West that now allowed the regime to survive resulted in a slight liberalization and in attempts to find a unique way into socialism. Nevertheless, this was the period during which UDV was rapidly becoming increasingly powerful and important, and its virtually absolute jurisdiction In principle, UDV was obliged to cooperate with the State Prosecutor's Office; in almost every case, however, the entire procedure, from detection to detention and administrative sentencing, was carried out by the service itself. – Uputstva za izsledni rad UDB, June 1947. Viri , 2003, No. 21, pp. 31–55 . and the fact that the top brass needed the service to be as efficient as possible resulted in increasingly serious cases of power abuse. In this period, the number of political prisoners was at its highest, and UDV, still structured according to military principles, was certainly present in the public consciousness. Transformed into a civilian structure in 1952. For details see: Pavle Čelik : Varovanje ustavnega reda in milica [Protection of the Constitutional Order and the Militia]. Viri , 2003, No. 22, p. 25 . When mentioning repression, the collective memory usually comes up with the worst examples of abuse, which characterized the initial years of the second Yugoslav state and had a significant impact on the lives of all people in Yugoslavia. According to Milko Mikola , such processes are a fundamental characteristic of any communist totalitarian system that carries out repressive activities against its citizens. Although he said that Yugoslavia did not differ much from other real socialist countries in this respect, Mikola also noted that the level of repression varied from one period to another. The period when state repression was at its worst can thus be placed between the end of World War II and 1952, a time mainly characterized by mass extrajudicial killings, forced forfeitures of property, show trials, forced labour sentences and deportations of people from their places of residence. Milko Mikola : Nekatere oblike represije komunističnega režima v Sloveniji v letih od 1945 do 1952 [Certain Forms of Communist Regime Repression in Slovenia between 1945 and 1952]. Zgodovina v šoli , 2010, No. 3–4, p. 5 . Despite the general mood of optimism that accompanied the creation of the new socialist system and despite the desire to surpass the set goals that pervade the official texts from that period, the general climate could also be described by using a Romanian aphorism from the time of the Ceaușescu regime: If you live in Romania, don't think, if you think, don't speak, if you speak, don't write, if you write, don't sign anything, and if you sign anything, don't be surprised. Če nisi mrtev, ni rečeno da si živ [Not Being Dead Does Not Necessarily Mean Being Alive]. Telex , 28 February 1989, p. 24 . Such political dissent mentality was apparently unable to grow roots in Slovenia as we can see the system softening and the level of self-censorship decreasing at certain stages of development, only for things to become more rigid again as the national government occasionally prosecutes and sentences certain intellectuals to make an example of them and clearly mark the limits of its tolerance.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36298/ch14.html#p-389" },
{ "title": "State Security", "text": "Although the security and intelligence service was, alongside the military, one of the most independent and centralized bodies in the country, beginning with the 1950s when Yugoslavia started a process of decentralization or at least claimed to be doing so, it operated at the level of the entities that made up the federation, but the operation was still exclusively controlled by the federal centre. Dornik Šubelj , Varnostno-obveščevalna služba, p. 142 . Formally, the service was part of the national Internal Affairs Secretariats as their Administration I (state security); the Administration II was in charge of public security, the Administration III controlled the People's Militia, and the Administration IV handled general matters. Ljuba Dornik Šubelj : Navodila varnostnim organom [Instructions to the Security Bodies]. Viri , 2003, No. 21, p. 15. The operation of UDV remained unchanged at both the federal and the national level throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, with the service monitoring potential and actual enemies of the system, and the power of its intertwined apparatus started to become a noticeable and significant factor in the divided Yugoslav leadership of the time. The 1960s brought the question of the future direction for the development of the Yugoslav system as the camp influenced by Party theorist Edvard Kardelj supported a rapid decentralization and the resulting reduction of the powers of the federal government, with the technocrats sitting in national governments usually desiring a further liberalization of the system, while the conservative camp was centred around Aleksandar Ranković who had been in control of internal affairs since World War II and was, at the time, considered the most likely successor to the Yugoslav leader Tito .", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36298/ch14.html#p-390" },
{ "title": "State Security", "text": "The increasingly numerous disagreements, which indicated that the fight for control over Yugoslavia after the death of President Josip Broz Tito , who was by then starting to show his age, would not be brief, led to Plenum IV of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in Brijuni in 1966, also called the Brijuni Plenum, which blew away the centrist camp and eliminated Ranković from the Yugoslav political sphere. Even today, the background of the Plenum remains unclear as allegations against Ranković were not based on any political errors but rather focused on misuses of the security and intelligence service for factional purposes, particularly after the listening devices were discovered in Tito's residence. There are many theories regarding the true reason for the elimination of Ranković and his associates, since certain centralist tendencies were supported even by Tito (at least until 1962). According to Milan Piljak , Ranković was probably sacrificed in order to bring unity to the top echelons of the Yugoslav Party, which was quite conceptually heterogeneous at the time. Ranković's weakened position is also reflected by the fact that he lost some of his functions in the federal administration, i.e. he lost most of his influence in bodies connected to internal affairs from 1962 to 1966. – Milan Piljak : Brionski plenum 1966. godine. Pokušaj istoriografskog tumačenja događaja. Tokovi istorije , 2010, No. 1, pp. 83 and 89 . The allegations that focused on the top levels of UDV thus broke up the conservative camp within the Party and greatly reduced the power UDV had in Yugoslavia. The helm of the Federal Internal Affairs Secretariat was taken over by Milan Mišković (who had good relations with the military intelligence service), Milan Mišković , the then Federal Secretary of Internal Affairs, who took his position in 1965, was the brother of Ivan Mišković who headed the military intelligence service from 1963 to 1971. which had played its cards at the Brijuni Plenum well, proving its allegiance the regime and thus receiving increased jurisdiction in the context of the operation of the system. The criticism of UDV's work was not hidden from the public, and various public forums began discussing the extent of misuses and questioning the ubiquity of the service The UDV supposedly kept files on over 1,300,000 Croatian citizens and had records of 200,000 potential enemies of the state in Serbia. For details, see: Jerca Vodušek Starič : Brionski plenum leta 1966 – ocene in njegov vpliv [The 1966 Brioni Plenum – Evaluations and Its Influence]. In: Slovenija - Jugoslavija, krize in reforme 1968/1988 [Slovenia – Yugoslavia, Crises and Reforms 1968/1988]. Ljubljana, 2010, pp. 67–88 . On the other hand, the published list of files the Slovenian SDV kept on individuals under surveillance indicates that the service was watching over 17,275 persons, with the last entry being the known Slovenian entrepreneur Ivo Boscarol : Evidenca dosjejev nadzorovanih oseb. Available at: http://www.arhiv.gov.si/si/uporaba_arhivskega_gradiva/sluzba_drzavne_varnosti/evidenca_dosjejev_nadzorovanih_oseb/ . which then underwent a mass human resources purge and complete reorganization in December of the same year. The service changed its name to State Security Service (SDV; Serbian: Služba državne bezbednosti (SDB)), and its internal division was supposed to mainly focus on the collection of data and reports that would serve the agency in discovering covert activities aimed at destroying or undermining the constitutional order, rather than on the prosecution of such activities. Obavezna instrukcija o medjusobnoj saradnji službe javne i državne bezbednosti, 22 April 1967. Viri , 2003, No. 22, pp. 147–148 . The SDV lost both the authority to carry out criminal proceedings as well as its the monopoly over the Prison Service. Vodušek Starič , Brionski plenum leta 1966, p. 84 . Border control and border services also came under the jurisdiction of individual republics. Informacija o prenosu pristojnosti za organizacijo in izvajanje nekaterih opravil službe DV na službo JV RSNZ SR Slovenije, 20 June 1967. Viri , 2003, No. 21, pp. 149–150 . The number of SDV employees was significantly reduced, The late 1960s reports on the activities of the Ljubljana surveillance team (which is not the same as the operatives' team) show interesting facts indicating that the two shifts of the team involved 20 people who performed slightly more than 1200 hours of surveillance work within two months and did so by using outdated equipment. The team's assignments were as follows: To follow, to obtain and maintain connections at hotels and the post service (PTT), to recruit sources of general information in the field, to verify and carry out checks for own needs and the needs of operative employees, to recruit informants or observers, to carry out secret investigations etc . In 11 months of 1968, the team followed 579 subjects as part of 900 cases by using a fleet of five vehicles. In addition to their own work, members of the surveillance team could also rely on the help of informants/collaborators: The dossier of address-specific sources lists 3,600 citizens (in the area of Ljubljana), however, these are not sources in the traditional sense of the word but rather helpful people willing to provide information on other people and not demanding a mutual relationship. – SI AS 1931, G–10–2, Organizacija – sistemizacija SDV 1970. Available at: http://www.arhiv.gov.si/fileadmin/arhiv.gov.si/pageuploads/SDV_2014/Organizacija_in_sistemizacija_SDV/SI_AS_1931_G-10-2_Organizacija_-_sistemizacija_SDV_1970.pdf . falling below 200 in the Slovenian territory, According to the document cited above, the Slovene SDV had 278 posts in the early 1970s, 204 of which were actually staffed. and numerous responsibilities were transferred from the state security to the public security sector. Dornik Šubelj , Navodila varnostnim organom, p. 21 . From that moment onwards, SDV was fully federalized, and although there a federal SDV still operated in Belgrade, its jurisdiction was further reduced and transferred to state and regional services; the intelligence service of the Foreign Affairs Secretariat became more independent as well. Nevertheless, the mentality of SDV did not change extensively as the domination of traditional thought patterns and priority assessments were present all the way up to the break-up of Yugoslavia. The main concern of the service were hostile emigrant groups, though the Cominform-related issues received a lot of attention too. This trend was further enhanced by events in the late 1970s and 1980s as various extremist formations from outside Yugoslavia attempted to carry out terrorist attacks, even in the Yugoslav territory – in 1972, SDV prevented an incursion of an armed formation composed of Croatian emigrants. Soviet operations in Czechoslovakia were another source of concern, as was the wave of student protests that started in the same year and, towards the end of the year, mutated into general protests against the existing constitutional arrangement in Kosovo, while the early 1970s were marked by an ousting of liberal politicians from the national governments in Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia. This is attested by the contents of the Information Bulletin of SDV (Informativni bilten SDV) from the early 1970s that also discussed dissidents among the intelligentsia. – SI AS 1931, MFZ A–21–26, Informativni bilten SDV za leto 1972.

This was the form that SDV, with minor modifications, retained until the break-up of the country; as the complex Yugoslav system evolved, the service was also involved with the general system of social self-protection and thus, in 1979, extended its structures to municipalities.", "tags": "", "loc": "http://www.sistory.si/cdn/publikacije/36001-37000/36298/ch14.html#p-391" },

{ "title": "Judiciary – Political Trials and Criminal Law", "text": "The judiciary is another extremely important part of state repression, particularly so for the socialist countries where the communist ideology dictated that the actual power be in the hands of the Party as the vanguard and representative of the working people. However, such tendencies could be quite problematic and were extremely rare in the Slovenian part of the judiciary, Among 144 permanent judges in Slovenia in 1951, 20 had no legal education. – Režek , Med resničnostjo in iluzijo , p. 13 . if we are to believe the following statement given by Miloš Minić upon the adoption of the Court System Act in 1945: If jurist judges served as permanent judges, formal justice would be allowed to prevail. Substantive justice must be dispensed by people who will know how to nurture the achievements of the national liberation struggle (NOB). Members of the NOB are better able to appreciate the political sense and meaning of the new laws than jurists who interpret legislation by the letter. Miroslav Perišić : Diplomatija i kultura . Belgrade, 2013, p. 14 . Single-mindedness was considered to be the most important feature of the Party, and such ideas applied to the government as well. Even formally, the judiciary system was initially not an independent third branch of the government, being instead susceptible to direct interventions by executive authorities, even the local ones, and to proceedings often conducted by UDV. That the role of the judiciary branch, together with the rest of the repressive apparatus, was much more repressive than today, was particularly evident from the end of World War II to 1953, when the adoption of constitutional legislation and societal shifts resulted in the position of the judiciary branch becoming at least formally similar to the position it holds today. The courts used to be controlled by local authorities, which resulted in frequent misuse assisted by the broadness of legislation, particularly regarding political offences. After 1953, the situation improved considerably, and the situation in Slovenia was characterized by a significant decrease in the number of political trials, dropping from approximately 1000 between 1947 and 1950 to 207 in 1952, 91 in 1953 and less than 50 in the following years. Režek , Med resničnostjo in iluzijo , p. 73 . The sovereignty of republics received another boost with the establishment of national constitutional courts pursuant to the Federal Constitution of 1963. Until then, Yugoslavia did not have a constitutional court, and the protection of legality was the province of socio-political communities. This meant that the highest segment of the judicial system, the constitutional judiciary, came under national jurisdiction, which was extremely important for the sovereignty of the republics as the national constitutions reflected the federal constitution, thus allowing the Slovenian constitutional court to decide in all matters related to national legislation and even in some matters connected to federal laws. Another important branch of the judiciary system eventually came under national jurisdiction, though this happened quite late. It was only the constitutional amendments of 1974 that allowed individual republics to take over the public prosecution service (law from 1977, in effect from 1979). Although the public prosecution had been organized on the territorial bases and received guidelines from national governments, it remained a body of the federal government, which operated in accordance with the instructions of the federal and national assemblies. Žarko Bizjak : Pravosodje v letih 1945–1991 [Justice Administration between 1945 and 1991]. In: Pravo–zgodovina–arhivi: I. prispevki za zgodovino pravosodja [Law – History – Archives: I. Contributions to the History of Justice Administration]. Ljubljana, 2000, pp. 290–293 . The judiciary system was thus the first apparatus to be fully put under national jurisdiction, with the exception of one segment that remained under federal jurisdiction – the military judiciary system; this, however, did not become politically problematic until 1988, when the issue inflamed the Slovenian public opinion at the time of the JBTZ trial. The fact that both the public prosecution service and the rest of the judiciary system operated in accordance with the tendencies favoured by the current government In the first few years after the war, much less attention was paid to conventional crime, although legal uncertainties led public prosecutors to try to ascribe political weight to even the most banal of offences. – Mateja Režek : Neodvisnost sodstva na preizkušnji.

Justice Administration and the System of Political Criminal Repression in Yugoslavia (1948–1959)]. Zgodovina za vse , 2002, No. 1, p. 83 . As quoted by Studen , Rabljev zamah , p. 118 . is also apparent from articles published by Belgrade-based newspapers. In 1987, a journalist of the Belgrade-based Duga , upon being prompted by one of our readers, pointed to a number of typically Slovenian situations (alternative movements, flyers protesting against a referendum, summaries of articles published by Mladina , and the debate regarding the alternative service of military recruits) and tried to show the reactions of the Slovenian public opinion and what would have happened if a similar situation occurred in any of the other seven Yugoslavian territories. As appealing as the assignment is, it is also extremely sensitive. Not because of any lack of information, but because such comparisons could stir up a political storm. This was anticipated by our reader as well, answering his own question about what would have happened if youths were distributing provocative leaflets against the ecological voluntary tax in any other territory as follows: 'They would probably be prosecuted' .
