In accordance with the concept of a modern parliamentary democracy, the constitution drawn up in 1990 and 1991 bestowed upon it a powerful role with numerous jurisdictions in the political and social life of the state. Besides the classic representative and legislative function (adopting the constitution, laws, budget, resolutions and national programmes, ratifying international agreements, calling referendums, deciding on the declaration of the state of war and state of emergency, etc.), the Slovenian parliament also performs a supervisory function (deciding on parliamentary investigations and votes of confidence, posing parliamentary questions, deciding on the impeachment of the President of the Republic, Prime Minister and the ministers) and elects, appoints and relieves its own leadership, government, judges, the ombudsman, the governor of the Bank of Slovenia, members of the Court of Auditors, etc.).</p><p class="milestone text-center">* * *</p><p id="p-300"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>To date the national assembly has concluded five terms of office. At the first National Assembly elections in 1992 the multiparty democracy was still very young, and the political space, in which the parties had not yet profiled themselves clearly in terms of their programmes, was therefore unclear. Every party took part in the elections with its own tactics, and low blows as well as serious struggles were not a rare occurrence. The campaign may also be ascribed with many transitional characteristics. It was a novelty and not only did it stir up the political life, but also the society in general, attracting many citizens and recounting many pungent stories which the journalists as well as the people could enjoy. The party leaders sought exposure, just like at all subsequent opportunities.</p><p id="p-301"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>The first structure of the National Assembly was quite fragmented, as eight parties qualified for it.

After the relations between the coalition and the opposition had been established, the parliament started addressing its extensive agenda. This primarily included the urgent legislative activities, since on one hand the former federal legislation had to be replaced, while on the other hand the basic acts of numerous state subsystems had to be adopted – from education, judiciary, tax system, ownership transformation and construction of the new economic system to national security, political parties and corruption. In accordance with its ambitious plan the parliament pursued its tasks diligently – the members of parliament mostly discussed the materials realistically and with appropriate political passion. The debates may have occasionally transcended the fields regulated by individual acts, but remained within the context of the issues at hand. However, since the very beginning the working enthusiasm of the parliament has not been in line with its public image. The people would never notice any diligent members of parliament. Apart from the basic legislative activities, the economic issues were the leitmotif of the first term of the National Assembly.

The parliament – the mirror of the society – found itself in a difficult situation, split in half... The initial session dragged on, and the opposing standpoints were evident at each step the parliament took. In the beginning of the term it seemed that the parliament had been idle for many months since the elections. However, the mere chronological facts do not convey much of a message, for dates scarcely mean anything on their own. In three months since the elections the parliament was nevertheless formed despite the stalemate, even elected its president with a large majority, carried out lengthy, occasionally bitter and remote but thorough and relevant discussions, and elected the Prime Minister.

Once again the election campaign took place and mostly the familiar parties and faces appeared in public... The Slovenian parliamentary-historical process gradually proceeded and evolved. The elections taking place at the turning point of the decade, century and millennium, were not an important milestone in themselves. However, symbolically they marked the onset of a new era. The first decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall, referred to as the time of freedom by the <q>best chronicler of the 20th century</q> <a id="oseba-1258"></a><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">Timothy Garton Ash</span></span><sup><a class="person" href="persons.html#pers.GartonTimothy" title="Imensko kazalo: oseba št. 1258">[os.]</a></sup>, drew to a close and the new <q>nameless decade</q>, an elusive time of an unclear character, was beginning. A year earlier the common European currency was introduced and NATO was extended to include the first three Eastern European countries, which had a special meaning for the processes of integration. Next year, on 5 October 2000, only ten days before the Slovenian elections, the last Yugoslav tyrant, Serbian leader <a id="oseba-1259"></a><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">Slobodan Milošević</span></span><sup><a class="person" href="persons.html#pers.MilosevicSlobodan" title="Imensko kazalo: oseba št. 1259">[os.]</a></sup>, was stripped of power in Belgrade. All of this can be seen as a historical censorship of a certain era. Slovenia was a part of these global developments. During the third term of the National Assembly it itself joined the European Union and NATO, which concluded (perhaps illusory) the process of the transition in this state.

If the evident strength of the coalition and weakness of the opposition were characteristic of the third term, we could conclude that the fourth term would be completely different in this regard. The coalition was less numerous, more diverse, and the opposition consisted of two experienced parties, which did not even give the new government the traditional 100 days of peace. Different circumstances and practices in the parliament were expected. However, no significant changes took place and the initial (unrealistic) expectations vanished. As it happened, the strength and public support of the coalition and the government were considerable in the beginning, and on the other hand the opposition succumbed to internal disorientation and dissolution.

Pahor's team conveyed an impression that it was aware of the situation. However, in the following months it responded slowly and hesitantly due to the Prime Minister's consensual approach. However, the first batch of anti-crisis measures was already addressed by the parliament towards the end of 2008. The MPs adopted it at the last session of the year, thus almost symbolically announcing the central problem of the fifth term: overcoming the situation, which finally developed from an economic into a political crisis.</p><p id="p-310"><span class="numberParagraph">12</span>Every important subject (or at least those underlined as important) involved a difference of opinions. When the government finally managed to agree on the resolution of the question of the border with the neighbouring Croatia, which we should undoubtedly see as one of its greatest successes, it immediately stumbled upon resolute protests of the opposition as well as some of the more prominent intellectuals (on the other hand a significant percentage of renowned intellectuals supported the agreement). Finally the parliament and the votes of the coalition supported the so-called Arbitration Agreement, but the strongly rooted doubts persisted. The pension scheme reform also gave rise to considerable opposition. In the context of reforming the labour market the coalition also adopted the Mini-jobs Act, radically amending the system of student work and shaking the foundations of the financial <q>empires</q> of the student organisations and student work services. Naturally, the students opposed the changes resolutely and organised student demonstrations in front of the National Assembly in May 2010. However, legitimate concerns about the new legislation turned into an unarticulated smearing campaign and even violence. Granite cobbles were flung through the air, a small fire broke out, and the parliament building (especially the entrance) was visibly damaged.

The debate on the new Family Code proposal can certainly be counted among the especially irreconcilable and controversial issues, at the same time bringing the attention to profound ideological, conceptual and even cultural-anthropological differences. The trust in the government and the parliament during this term was still low, dissatisfaction grew, and the economic crisis had been an evident fact for quite a while. The political space remained unappeasable and the coalition gave an increasing impression of being blocked within and without, not having any real ideas of how to solve the situation.

The fifth term ended with the dissolution of the National Assembly by the President of the Republic on 21 October 2011, after the government had received a vote of no confidence and in the absence of any new candidates for Prime Minister. For the first time in the almost 20-year history of the Slovenian parliament an early election was called for 4 December.

This certainly does not mean that they did not exist and that they did not influence the voters' decisions, but the majority of the political debates nevertheless focused on overcoming the economic crisis and finding <q>exit</q> strategies. Even in the beginning of October the political atmosphere was still predictable. However, only a bit later the political space started to change radically as new political faces and new parties started entering the political arena one after the other. The fact that the voters were fed up with the established candidates resulted in a turning point.
