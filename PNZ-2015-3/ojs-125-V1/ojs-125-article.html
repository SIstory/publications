It existed for barely six months, from the day of its constitution on 5 April 1990 to 2 October 1990, during which it passed more than 150 laws and 100 resolutions at a total of 38 plenary meetings. Key examples include the treaty to establish a monetary, economic and social union with the Federal Republic of Germany, the Unification Treaty, the law governing the introduction of the five Länder (states), and the Stasi-Unterlagen-Gesetz,<span id="ojs-125-ftn2_return"><a class="notelink" title="“Treaty on the establishment of a monetary, economic and social union between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic,” Ges…" href="#ojs-125-ftn2"><sup>1</sup></a></span> although there were also laws on hospital financing, freely financed housing, and the application of a trades and crafts code, just to name a few. As the GDR’s first and last freely elected democratic parliament, it was responsible for organising the East German side of the legally and economically complex German unification process, and in doing so dissolve itself and the state whose citizens it represented. As if this were not enough, the task had to be completed by MPs with next to no experience in the workings of a parliamentary democracy or parliamentary operations. Its history is also made interesting by the fact that the (self-)parliamentarisation process played out in the public eye, i.e. people could watch newly-elected MPs rapidly learning the ropes of their “profession” without the guidance of experienced colleagues. And it literally was a case of “watching”, for televisions were there live at all times.</p><p id="ojs-125-p-13"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>The election win by the conservative “Allianz für Deutschland” (“Alliance for Germany”), a coalition of the Christian Democrats (Christlich Demokratische Union, CDU), the Democratic Awakening (Demokratischer Aufbruch, DA) and the German Social Union (Deutsche Soziale Union, DSU), on 18 March 1990 clearly demonstrated that most GDR citizens wanted to be reunified with the Federal Republic, and have their living conditions aligned with the West, as quickly as possible, for the Allianz’s proposed policy had included the demand for a liberal constitutional democracy, the federal unification of Germany as per Article 23 of the West German Basic Law, and a consistent, socially and ecologically-oriented marked economy.<span id="ojs-125-ftn3_return"><a class="notelink" title="“ʻAllianz für Deutschland’ zu den Volkskammerwahlen am 18.

The sections thereafter describe how it geared itself around the West German model, and what role the media played. Finally, the example of the formation of the five new states within the GDR shows that, while the West German model did certainly align with some of the East’s ideals, critical aspects were still dictated by the West.</p><div class="subchapter" id="ojs-125-articel-sub01"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.1. </span><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="ojs-125-head-7">The initial situation</span></h3><p id="ojs-125-p-16"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The constitutive meeting held at 11am on the morning of 5 April 1990 marked the start of the final legislative period of a parliament which, until just a few months prior, had not even earned its reputation as such.<span id="ojs-125-ftn5_return"><a class="notelink" title="Regarding the Volkskammer, cf.

Specifically speaking, this meant there were no career parliamentarians, since MPs worked on a voluntary basis. They convened two, maximum three, times a year in East Berlin for a meeting which lasted not much longer than a day, before returning to their homes and regular places of employment. This was allegedly the only way to guarantee close contact with the working population. There was no separation of powers either. According to the official description, the Volkskammer instead fulfilled “the principle of unity in decision-making and execution. [… A]s a working body, it ensures its decisions are implemented, and exercises control here.”<span id="ojs-125-ftn6_return"><a class="notelink" title="Herbert Kelle and Tord Riemann, Die Volkskammer – wie sie arbeitet (Berlin: Staatsverlag der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik, 1989), 12." href="#ojs-125-ftn6"><sup>5</sup></a></span></p><p id="ojs-125-p-17"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>The GDR’s Constitution stated that it was the highest state power. Until well into the 1980s, Volkskammer elections regularly recorded fantastic participation levels of over 98 percent, with equally fantastic results nudging the 100-percent mark for the unity list (Einheitsliste) of the ten GDR mass organisations and parties pooled under the “National Front”. While bloc parties the CDU, Liberal Democrats (Liberaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands, LDPD), National Democrats (National-Demokratische Partei Deutschlands, NDPD) and the Farmers’ Party (Demokratische Bauernpartei Deutschlands, DBD), as well as mass organisations like the Free German Youth (Freie Deutsche Jugend, FDJ) and the Free German Trade Union Association (Freier Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund, FDGB), officially masqueraded under the guise of pluralism, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (Sozialistische Einheitspartei, SED) in fact ran roughshod over them. The allocation of seats was already established before any “election”.<span id="ojs-125-ftn7_return"><a class="notelink" title="Hans Michael Kloth, Vom ʻZettelfaltenʼ zum freien Wählen: Die Demokratisierung der DDR 1989/90 und die ʻWahlfrageʼ (Berlin: Links, 2000)." href="#ojs-125-ftn7"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p><p id="ojs-125-p-18"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>At the start, the Volkskammer hardly ever reacted to what was happening on the streets of the GDR in the autumn of 1989, remaining a loyal supporter of the system for some time.<span id="ojs-125-ftn8_return"><a class="notelink" title="For the course of events, cf.

The first signs of life were slow in coming; even the meeting on 24 October, in which Egon Krenz was elected Erich Honecker’s successor as head of the State Council in a public ballot, followed the same familiar format, albeit introducing dissenting votes and abstentions. But all of a sudden, the MPs themselves insisted on tighter meetings schedules and the formation of enquiry committees, and called for previously withheld information and discussions. The beginnings of a humble democratisation process start to show as of 13 November 1989. In December, the SED’s leading role was omitted from the Constitution.<span id="ojs-125-ftn9_return"><a class="notelink" title="Cf. the minutes of the last nine meetings of the 9th Volkskammer (October 24, 1989 to March 6/7, 1990).

Way off the mark were the Liberals with 5.3 percent and Alliance 90/The Green Party (Bündnis 90/Grüne), the coalition of various civil-rights and environmental conservation groups, with 4 percent. Rounding things off were the members of Germany’s Democratic Farmers’ Party (DBD) and the Democratic Women’s Federation of Germany (Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands, DFD) on 2.5 percent, and a single member of the United Left (Vereinigte Linke). On 12 April, the CDU, DA, DSU, Liberals and SPD formed a Grand Coalition, which held a crushing majority of 303 to 97 votes in the Volkskammer.<span id="ojs-125-ftn12_return"><a class="notelink" title="The balances of power were to shift in summer, when, first the Liberals in July, then the Social Democrats in August, left the Coalition: Barely a mon…" href="#ojs-125-ftn12"><sup>11</sup></a></span></p><p id="ojs-125-p-22"><span class="numberParagraph">7</span>The task lying before the 400 newly elected MPs – 409 including the successors -<span id="ojs-125-ftn13_return"><a class="notelink" title="Christopher Hausmann, Biographisches Handbuch der 10.

Not only were the newly elected MPs very unclear as to what they had to do and how to go about it, there were other factors as well. One was that they did not know each other. And this did not just mean that, for example, the members of the SPD party were not aware who their colleagues from the CDU, PDS or Liberals were; even within the individual parties, people initially hardly knew the person sitting in front or next to them. Key functions within the parties, whether these be president, committee chairperson or work-group chairperson, had to be filled without properly assessing whether the candidate was even suited to the task. It was the same story when selecting speakers in the plenum. If, due to lack of experience or information, it was impossible to ascertain the strengths and weaknesses of one’s own members, one was dependent on guesswork and leaps of faith.</p><p id="ojs-125-p-24"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>For many MPs, it only became clear once actually in Berlin that being elected meant giving up their previous job and performing their new task on a full-time basis, at least for a certain period, whose duration was unknown. While the old Volkskammer was content with two or three meetings a year, meeting frequency now rapidly increased. On average, there was one plenary session a week, often more, plus the usual party, work-group and committee meetings, some special sittings, including on Sundays, with some meetings spanning several consecutive days or lasting well into the night. If many MPs initially assumed they would at least have a few hours during the week to continue pursuing their original career, in keeping with the old GDR ideal of voluntary MPs, they were taught otherwise within the first few days of their attendance in parliament: Adoption of the Western parliamentary model had transformed them into career politicians virtually overnight. A Volkskammer mandate left no time for sideline work. But it also meant the MPs had to be paid for their work, since they had lost their original source of income. The introduction of per-diem allowances was inevitable.</p><p id="ojs-125-p-25"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Discussions on this topic particularly revealed the unease many parliamentarians felt at having to set their own income amount. Reinhard Höppner (SPD), chairperson of the work group commissioned with the draft legislation, put this malaise into words: “I’d love to find a way out of it. As a result of having to be the chairperson of this committee, I have ended up in the less than ideal position of now also having to report on it here.”<span id="ojs-125-ftn14_return"><a class="notelink" title="7th meeting on 17 May 1990. ̶ Protokolle der Volkskammer der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik: 10.

As many MPs found the amount inappropriately high (3600 GDR Marks plus 2300 GDR Marks flat allowance, said amount being paid out in D-Marks upon the conversion of currency on 1 July. Members of the old Volkskammer only received an allowance of 500 GDR Marks), they donated part of their income. The per-diem allowances did, however, remain a main point of criticism in public discussions.<span id="ojs-125-ftn15_return"><a class="notelink" title="See BArch DA 1/16731, the letters to the Volkskammer." href="#ojs-125-ftn15"><sup>14</sup></a></span></p><p id="ojs-125-p-26"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>In March 1990, it became clear that MPs coming from outside Berlin required permanent housing where they could not only sleep and eat, but ideally also work. Large-volume accommodation was, however, rare in Berlin at this time, and most MPs ended up living in a former home for single Stasi officers on Ruschestraße in Berlin Lichtenberg. The facility first had to be urgently renovated, was not finished on time, and also lacked space, forcing some MPs to share rooms. And these MPs were not always from the same party, resulting in an atmosphere akin to a youth hostel – a notion fuelled further by the fact that the residents would meet in the evenings for guitar sing-alongs. However, this cross-party bonding undoubtedly also helped them get to know each other better, and break down any initial mistrust.<span id="ojs-125-ftn16_return"><a class="notelink" title="Paul Krüger, “Für einen geordneten Einigungsprozeß – zur Arbeit der CDU/CDA-Fraktion,” in Mandat für deutsche Einheit.

As one of many occupants, the Volkskammer had no other choice but to find other rooms to work in. The parties finally took up quarters in the former building of the SED’s central committee at Werderscher Markt, which had now been renamed the “Haus der Parlamentarier” or “House of Parliamentarians”. The plenum also had to relocate there for the last two meetings after the Palast der Republik closed overnight due to an asbestos risk. Many MPs were mortified at having to move to this of all places. Apart from this, the Lenin Hall where meetings were held was merely a conference room and in no way suitable for parliamentary proceedings. There was no separation between the parties; MPs sat closely next to one another, making vote counts extremely complex. Visitors and journalists had to crowd around the room’s side walls, because there was no separate seating for them.</p></div><div class="subchapter" id="ojs-125-articel-sub03"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.3. </span><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="ojs-125-head-9">Help from the West</span></h3><p id="ojs-125-p-29"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>In view of all these challenges, the “big brothers” from the West provided urgently required help and guidance – insofar as sister parties existed, (as with SPD, CDU, the Liberals and Bündnis 90/Grüne), for parties like PDS and DBD/DFD had none.<span id="ojs-125-ftn18_return"><a class="notelink" title="The CDU and Liberals had emerged from the GDR bloc parties CDU/NDPD, LDPD, while the SPD and Grüne were founded during the autumn of 1989." href="#ojs-125-ftn18"><sup>17</sup></a></span> It would likely have been virtually impossible for the Volkskammer to operate without the material and non-material assistance of the Federal Republic of Germany, which included technical equipment such as copiers, fax machines, telephones and cars, but also information, training, counselling or simply money. For example, the SPD, which received probably the best planned and most comprehensive aid, had a contact office in East Berlin from as early as January 1990. The party organised training sessions and information presentations before the 10th Volkskammer was even constituted, and also provided the essential legal support, for the difficulties started with the previously unheard-of technology, which had to be painstakingly learned. At one point, 16 West German consultants were working for the Social Democrats in the Volkskammer.<span id="ojs-125-ftn19_return"><a class="notelink" title="Martin Gutzeit, “Aufbau, Organisation und Arbeit der SPD-Fraktion der Volkskammer,” in »Die Handschrift der SPD muss erkennbar sein«: Die Fraktion der…" href="#ojs-125-ftn19"><sup>18</sup></a></span></p><p id="ojs-125-p-30"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Certain periods saw Bonn colleagues figuring in almost all parties and sometimes even in the Volkskammer’s house gallery – a demonstration of affiliation always met by heartfelt approval from the plenum.<span id="ojs-125-ftn20_return"><a class="notelink" title="Cf. particularly the meeting on June 17, 1990, which was especially criticised by the PDS.

For example, the number and layout of the committees in the Volkskammer was geared around the Bonn model, as was the number and layout of the ministries or work groups within the parties. The parties themselves also copied their respective sister parties. Bündnis 90/Grüne, for instance, adopted the model of having multiple spokespersons at the head of the party instead of one single leader – which was very appropriate for this highly heterogeneous combination of four groups originating in the civil-rights and environmental movement. This prevented certain members from being disadvantaged during the allocation of leadership positions. In the CDU/DA party, on the other hand, MPs formed state groups at a time when states did not exist in the GDR – another imitation of the West German model. The CDU in the Federal German Republic traditionally had very strong state associations, major regional differences, and a much more pluralist, decentralised organisational structure than, for example, the Social Democrats, and this was also reflected in the organisation of the Bundestag party, which similarly featured regional sub-groups, the strongest of which being the single-party CSU-Landesgruppe.<span id="ojs-125-ftn21_return"><a class="notelink" title="Cf.

The Volkskammer’s old rules of procedure from 1974 were totally inadequate for modern, democratic parliamentary proceedings. They were modified out of necessity in April, and then definitively replaced in July 1990 by a version closely resembling that adopted by the German Bundestag. But the first drafts of this new version existed even before the election in March 1990. The Volkskammer’s administration had prepared a draft drawing on the Volkskammer rules of procedure from 1949, those of the Weimar Reichstag and those of the German Bundestag. The SPD also started off with an elaborate draft inspired by the Bundestag’s rules of procedure.</p><p id="ojs-125-p-33"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>Despite this comprehensive help, a lot went wrong in everyday parliamentary life – though this is not a huge surprise. Parliaments are complex institutions which operate in accordance with countless written and unwritten rules.

Only the deputy head of parliament, Reinhard Höppner (SPD), actually knew how to use them to run a parliamentary session, primarily thanks to his experience as president and chair at Protestant Church synods, though he also had a gift for the task. Not only was he truly familiar with the various version of the rules of procedure, he was particularly able to anticipate situations and their consequences, think in alternatives, and find solutions in challenging scenarios. No other members of the steering committee, not even the president Sabine Bergmann-Pohl or her six deputies were able to do this, and often found themselves floundering. Other parliamentary processes also required practice, whether it was an “Aktuelle Stunde”, correct composition and lodging of a petition, or the formalities for applying for a procedural motion. Or even just the knowledge that, according to information provided by the specialists from the work groups and committees, party meetings are there to discuss and establish the strategy for the plenum, and do not have to act as the place of endless debates on principles, especially when under time constraints.</p></div><div class="subchapter" id="ojs-125-articel-sub04"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.4. </span><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="ojs-125-head-10">The 10th Volkskammer and the media</span></h3><p id="ojs-125-p-35"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The 10th Volkskammer was permanently monitored throughout all of this.

A detailed GDR TV report from the Chamber began as early as 24 October 1989, i.e. the final phase of the 9th Volkskammer. The TV covered the final eight meetings of this legislative period live, broadcasting some 60 hours from the Palast der Republik between 24 October 1989 and 7 March 1990. The live coverage of the 10th Volkskammer continued this practice. </p><p id="ojs-125-p-37"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>All parties involved expected a lot from it, not least the citizens, who naturally wanted to see how their representatives handled their mandate.

With this new understanding of the public sphere, enabling the citizens to watch them perform their work, the MPs purposely wanted to break away from the practices of their predecessor. “Watch” can also easily be replaced with the word “monitor”, for that is what it boiled down to. This became particularly apparent in the constitutive meeting to elect the president and steering committee. What was unusual about it was the method for counting the votes, which took place in front of everyone in the Chamber, with the head of the Volkskammer administration, surrounded by the parties’ secretaries, reading out each individual ballot paper.<span id="ojs-125-ftn23_return"><a class="notelink" title="Cf. the video recordings of the meeting dated April 5, 1990: Deutscher Bundestag: On-Demand Video, accessed October 12, 2015, http://webtv.bundestag.d…" href="#ojs-125-ftn23"><sup>22</sup></a></span> As transparent and comprehensible as this process was for everyone, it was also extremely tedious, and tested the patience of MPs, journalists and viewers alike.

This demonstration of regional identity was thus a clear political statement against the centralist GDR and in favour of the federal restructuring.

The task it had been assigned with the victory of the “Allianz für Deutschland”, namely to arrange reunification with the Federal Republic of Germany as quickly as possible, allowed very few alternatives or independent solutions. Parliamentary structures first had to be established. This affected institutional aspects just as much as it did the work methods and everyday organisational matters of the MPs, including relations between the parliament and the media and public.</p><p id="ojs-125-p-52"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>Neither the meeting venue nor the working conditions were appropriate, the role of MP had to be defined and adapted to the new requirements, and unknown parliamentary institutions and formalities had to be introduced and tested. All this had to be borne by parliamentary novices, making the need for assistance inevitable. This help, which came largely from West German affiliate parties, as well as the German Bundestag, was extensive, albeit not totally selfless, for it also pursued personal interests in relation to future election successes. The help included supplies of material and money, as well as immaterial support through information, training and counselling.</p><p id="ojs-125-p-53"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>The 10th Volkskammer of the GDR differed from established parliaments in many respects. In terms of its operating style, it was generally considered more passionate, more spontaneous, more geared around consensus, and more interested in fact-based, cross-party problem-solving rather than fierce political discussions following rigid party boundaries. But we must be cautious about construing this as a new, fresher, more spontaneous, “more humane” form of parliamentary culture which contrasts with the reputedly cold, aloof, professional Bonn/Berlin setup. As time passed, the MPs’ harsh self-criticism gave way to a milder view of things, which outweighed the enthusiasm over the experiences gained at the time. Much of what was deemed negative and detrimental in 1990 was reinterpreted as a positive: Chaos gave rise to improvisation, and a lack of combativeness resulted in a preference for objective discussion and consensual decision-making. This focus on consensus undoubtedly tied in with the still-ambiguous differentiation between political parties, the difficulty of the task, and the common goals despite all differences, but also with the lack of parliamentary practice and uncertainty in dealings with one another. Party discipline was, without question, also far less intense than it is today, but conduct deviating from the party line during votes can easily be tolerated when you have the comfortable majority the coalition had in its first few months. A greater focus was also placed on discipline within the parties in the Volkskammer once things became less cut-and-dried for critical votes. There were also controversial interjections, heated debates and personal attacks.</p><p id="ojs-125-p-54"><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>The “either/or” question raised in the title is thus too strict. The 10th Volkskammer of the GDR was indeed a keen student; it was capable of learning and incredibly diligent. But its work was never completely heteronomous – both sides had identical intentions, not just in the case of establishing the new states – nor was it a parliament with a true culture of its own. The external circumstances, including considerable time constraints, in which it operated required a pragmatic approach to the extremely complex tasks. Well-honed rules and processes which had been tried and tested elsewhere were used. While this left little room for its own initiatives, it did enable things to run more or less smoothly.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="small-6 columns text-center"><p><a class="button" href="ojs-125-abstract.html" title="Previous: Abstract">&lt;&lt;</a></p></div><div class="small-6 columns text-center"><p><a class="button" href="ojs-125-bibliogr.html" title="Next: Sources and references">&gt;&gt;</a></p></div></div><!--Notes in [div]--><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Notes</div><div class="note" id="ojs-125-ftn1"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ojs-125-ftn1_return"><sup>*</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">researcher, PhD, Kommission für Geschichte des Parlamentarismus und der politischen Parteien (KGParl), Schiffbauerdamm 40, 10117 Berlin, Germany, <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="mailto:tueffers@kgparl.de">tueffers@kgparl.de</a></span></p></div><div class="note" id="ojs-125-ftn2"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ojs-125-ftn2_return"><sup>1.</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">“Treaty on the establishment of a monetary, economic and social union between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic,” <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Gesetzblatt der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik</span> 1: 332. “Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic on the establishment of German unity,” <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Gesetzblatt der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik</span> 1: 1627. “Constitutional law on the formation of states within the German Democratic Republic,” <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Gesetzblatt der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik</span> 1: 955. “Law on protecting and using personal data from the former Ministry for State Security/National Security Office,” <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Gesetzblatt der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik</span> 1: 1419.</span></p></div><div class="note" id="ojs-125-ftn3"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ojs-125-ftn3_return"><sup>2.</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">“ʻAllianz für Deutschland’ zu den Volkskammerwahlen am 18.
