                    With the disintegration of the communist party, the Federal Assembly became
                    unexpectedly a key constitutional institution with far reaching powers in times
                    of rapid political change. The revolutionary movement Civic Forum forced through
                    a legislation that enabled to recall substantial part of the members of the
                    parliament and replace them by its own candidates through co-optation. This
                    method of “cleansing” of the parliament had far-reaching consequences for the
                    post-November Czechoslovak political culture.</p>

                        in 1989 were aware that it was impossible to mobilise masses, improvise and
                        keep on surprising the opponent and, at the same time, remain democrats.
                        “We, who fight for democracy, cannot be democrats,” Timothy Garton Ash thus
                        paraphrased Brecht when characterising the strategy of the Civic Forum.<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn3" n="2">Timothy Garton Ash, <hi rend="italic">We The People: The Revolution of 89 Witnessed in Warsaw, Budapest,
                                Berlin &amp; Prague</hi> (London: Penguin Books, 1990), 89.</note>
                        The revolutionariesʼ dilemma in 1989 was not new and, in different form, is
                        present within every modern revolution. In case of anti-Communist
                        revolutions, however, an additional fact played a role: the old régimes were
                        equipped with formally democratic constitutions and elected institutions.
                        Moreover, with the disintegration of the power of Communist Parties, the
                        Communist constitutions and parliaments were often the only means to hold
                        the supranational states together. Furthermore, the Opposition had played,
                        for some time, a peculiar game with the state when pretending to be taking
                        seriously the formal constitutionality and democratic nature of the
                        Communist régime and addressing its protests to the Federal Assembly or the
                        Federal Government, instead of the Party bodies. Naturally, the
                        constitutional institutions responded by using police repressions.<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn4" n="3">Cf. ICH, COH, collection Interviews. An
                            interview with Dana Němcová, Prague, March 12, 2012.</note> The
                        revolutions of 1989 thus had to be (and, at the same time, could not be) not
                        merely democratic, but also constitutionally correct. This political
                        contradiction led to constitutional improvisations across Eastern Europe. In
                        Czechoslovakia the improvisations assumed a particularly imaginative shape
                        in co-optations to parliamentary and other elected institutions in December
                        1989 and January 1990.</p>
               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-11">Legally, co-optation means an extension of the number of members of an
                        institution by electing additional members. Sociologically, then,
                        co-optation means integration of a marginal Opposition group into the
                        mainstream. In Czechoslovakia, co-optation was used for all three
                        parliaments and national committees following a proposal by Zdeněk Jičínský,
                        constitutional specialist and dissident, based on roundtable political
                        accords of the second half of December 1989 and early January 1990.
                        Co-optations were to serve as expedient means to remove politically
                        compromised individuals from the representative assemblies and to replace
                        them with members of the two revolutionary movements – the Civic Forum and
                        the Public Against Violence. It thus entailed two intertwined processes of
                        dismissal and co-optation of deputies. The politically pivotal co-optations
                        to the Federal Assembly were exercised in two waves. First, on 28 December
                        1989, a day before the Presidential election of Václav Havel, over twenty
                        MPs were co-opted including Alexander Dubček who was instantly elected
                        Chairman of the Federal Assembly. Shortly after the dramatic adoption of the
                        bill on the dismissal of deputies, early January 1990 saw the second wave of
                        co-optations that was far more extensive and introduced over 130 additional
                        MPs to the Federal Assembly. The change (officially termed reconstruction)
                        of both national councils and national committees in larger cities proved
                        equally radical. Whilst the co-optations were generally accepted in the
                        Czech lands as a pragatic solution, they faced (ineffective) resistance in
                        Slovakia not merely among Communist deputies, but also within the
                        Opposition.</p>
               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-12">The following analysis of co-optations is part of a wider research into the
                        Federal Assembly in 1989–1992 that explores the mechanisms of
                        “self-parliamentarisation”, a process of gradual emancipation of legislative
                        vis-à-vis executive power. The study has three objectives. First, it follows
                        upon the work by Jiří Suk on the revolutionary months at the break of 1989
                        and 1990.<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn5" n="4">Cf. e.g. Jiří Suk,
                            “Czechoslovakia in 1989: Causes, Results, and Conceptual Changes,” in

                            Wissenschaften, 2015), 137–160.</note> Using similar methodologies and
                        sources (the archive of the Civic Forum) the study attempts to explore one
                        of the side corridors of the “labyrinth of revolution”. Co-optations are
                        often deemed to be “the ancestral sin” at the beginning of many subsequent
                        failures in the 1990s. Hence it is worth exploring what led to the situation
                        and their possible alternatives. Second, the very topic of the Federal
                        Assembly and the sources it generates (verbatim transcripts of plenary
                        debates, debates in committees and at the presidium, as well as interviews
                        with former MPs) offer an additional opportunity to approach the revolution
                        of November 1989 from the perspective of the marginalised or defeated
                        stakeholders. In contrast with Havelʼs vision of moral and aesthetic
                        revolution that destroys all dire and ugly, the struggle for the dominance
                        in the parliament sheds light on the reform vision of an “articled
                        revolution”<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn6" n="5">Valtr Komárek,

                        revolution against the dragging time of parliamentary democracy. This is
                        also the ideological world of those defeated, the MPs who did not want to be
                        merely used and discarded by the Civic Forum , but to be part of the
                        changes, fighting for their right to consent, to which they were entitled
                        even under the Communist régime.</p>

               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-13">Co-optations fall within a particular Czech political tradition under which
                        elections were never used in key historical junctures to achieve new
                        legitimacy. In 1918, at the time of the foundation of Czechoslovakia, the
                        National Committee and subsequently the National Assembly were established
                        as revolutionary bodies of political parties. They bore no political
                        continuity with land assemblies and the Imperial Council. After Munich the
                        change in geographical and political map was manifested in the so called
                        short parliament where members from the occupied regions lost mandates, as
                        did subsequently the members from the Communist Party. After the war the
                        main political parties recognised the continuity of Presidential office, but
                        not that of the parliament. The interim national assembly was thus called by
                        the President by decree. Even though the parties were to again delegate
                        their deputies, the post-war developments have brought a new understanding
                        of parliament not as part of the division of power, but as the supreme
                        constituent of self-government.<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn7" n="6">Jan

                        extended the term of parliamentary mandate from the standard four years to a
                        total of seven. Particularly, however, it enabled cleansing within the
                        parliaments. The Act empowered representative assemblies to strip their MPs
                        of a mandate, <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> because “his or her activity
                        harms the politics of the National Front.” By the 1971 elections, about one
                        quarter of MPs in the Federal Assembly were thus replaced along with nearly
                        one half of deputies in the Czech National Council. The Council, due to the
                        date of its foundation during the hot summer of the Prague Spring, exerted
                        greater resistance to the post-August leadership. All changes derived
                        formally from the mandate, albeit quite dubious, arising from the last
                        elections to the National Assembly in 1964. For instance, Zdeněk Jičínský,
                        the author of the post-November co-optation, first served as MP in the Czech
                        National Council and later also in the Federal Assembly, only to lose both
                        mandates a year later: the process ensued without – even formal – voter
                        involvement.</p>
               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-15">The Czechoslovak model of co-optations was not used during the fall of
                        Communism in any of the countries within the Soviet bloc. Yet all of them
                        (with the exception of Romania), faced quite similar structural issue: how
                        to deal with the constitutional legacy of Communism, particularly the
                        legislative power of the parliament.<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn12" n="11">On Communist parliaments in the Soviet bloc see Daniel Nelson and

                        the old régime fell, all countries within the former Soviet bloc had
                        legislatures constructed upon the model of the Stalinist constitution of
                        1936 (although virtually all of them had been transformed by major
                        constitutional changes in the 1970s and 1980s). Those parliaments were
                        mostly “elected” in the early days of perestroika. The reformist or
                        revolutionary élites had to raise a question whether a Communist parliament
                        is actually a parliament and what the consequences are of such a query.
                        Reformers, revolutionaries and conservatives included, to varying degrees,
                        parliaments in their strategies, and parliamentary officials sought their
                        place on the newly emerging political map. Year 1989 thus has not entailed
                        as much a “return to democracy”, and certainly not in its interwar shape,
                        but adaptation of “socialist democracy” and its constitutionalism to the
                        context of open society. Similarly to the study of post-Communist
                        nationalism, this paper also refutes the “freezer” thesis which claims that
                        Communism merely froze ethnic conflicts that resurfaced during the political
                        meltdown.<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn13" n="12">Cf. e.g. Katherine

                        Communism not merely preserved, but mainly created and constituted political
                        institutions. Additionally, Communist parliaments in the constituent
                        republics in federal states were able to become (and often became indeed)
                        the main instrument for the constitution of nation states. Similarly to
                        disintegration, Communist parliament played an important role in the German
                        unification. The East German <hi rend="italic">Volkskammer</hi> that gained
                        new legitimacy by the hastily called early elections in March 1990, proved

                        serve at the Federal Assembly. At the time Jičínskýʼs proposal for
                        co-optations did not lead, to political regrouping of the parliament, but
                        rather to its cleansing. The aim was to cleanse the parliament and to retain
                        it operability at the same time. Jičínskýʼs erudition was manifested in the
                        fact that he realised well before anyone else among the leaders of the Civic
                        Forum, the risk of spontaneous pressure on resignations of MPs that would

                        to mobilise the public to exert sufficient pressure upon individual MPs to
                        resign willingly. The situation faced by the deputies, particularly those
                        who did not represent the central institutions of power, but were to
                        represent the society (regionally, professionally, in terms of age and
                        gender) was unenviable. The Communist régime used the deputies as one of the
                        means to communicate with the public and to control public criticism. The
                        deputies, as members of the Federal Assembly, were quite well known within

                        “representatives”, but those of the régime. At regular meetings with voters
                        in their local constituencies particularly during the late perestroika, they
                        had to to listen to criticism of the failing régime without having had any
                        opportunity to affect the situation. The deputies had no power during
                        Communism, the less so during the revolution, hence they lacked political

                        Václav Havel for President, one of the key activists of the Civic Forum
                        stated that there was no danger of any resistance on their part: “Such

               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-19">The issue, however, was that the Opposition did not need a “pure” parliament,
                        but an operational one. Following the dismissal of MPs, the vacated seats
                        had to be filled again. Constitutional Acts were adopted by a three-quarter
                        majority of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> MPs, not merely of those present.
                        Therefore, in combination with the ban on majorisation,<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn21" n="20">The “minority veto” protected the Slovak MPs from
                            being outvoted by their more numerous Czech counterparts.</note> an
                        absence of 31 MPs in either the Czech of Slovak section of the House of
                        Nations was enough to curb adoption of a Constitutional Act. The electoral
                        law at the time allowed for by-elections, whilst also accounting for the
                        possibility of choosing from a number of candidates. Yet by-elections,
                        similarly to direct election of the President, were in conflict with
                        “partial mobilisation” used by the Civic Forum to successfully marginalise
                        its political competitors. The Civic Forum was the only one to manage to
                        dominate public urban space and, in the free elections, it faced unnecessary
                        competition. In a dispute with Zdeněk Jičínský over whether Havelʼs
                        candidacy enjoyed broad public support, Václav Benda, the key figure of the
                        Catholic Opposition, put the point accurately: “We are not dealing here as
                        much of with some vague opinion of broad masses. In this particular
                        situation it is the active masses who decide.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn22" n="21">Jiří Suk, <hi rend="italic">Občanské fórum,

                        however, was that the Civic Forum did not know how to control the voting
                        machine to generate the right legislation and, particularly, to elect the
                        right President. Petr Pithart summarised the uncertainty quite well: “What
                        was agreed yesterday is one thing, certainly. The other matter is how to
                        arrange for the people in the parliament to accept it. Because the Party
                        will only tell them two more things: To go to hell and to elect Vašek Havel.
                        And they will be casting secret vote! I am not certain whether these two
                        instructions might prove mutually contradictory. No one can force and check
                        on them.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn26" n="25">Suk, <hi rend="italic">Občanské fórum</hi>, 197.</note>
               </p>
               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-21">The Civic Forum soon came to realise that, not only did it not know how to
                        make the Federal Assembly elect Václav Havel to Presidency, but also that it
                        had been unable to prevent the other side from using it. During the second
                        roundtable talks on 11 December, Vasil Mohorita surprised the Civic Forum
                        when he announced that he would propose to the Federal Assembly a change of
                        the Constitution in order to introduce direct election of the President. The
                        Communist Party thus took over the initiative for a while and put the Civic
                        Forum in a paradoxical situation of a defender of Communist
                        constitutionalism and opponent of direct democracy. The Communist Party
                        showed that it was also able to reach for “revolutionary” methods. As Zdeněk
                        Jičínský emphasised in his response to the proposal, direct election of the
                        President would not only be in conflict with the existing constitutional
                        tradition of parliamentary democracy, but would be in utter conflict with
                        the spirit of the Constitutional Act on Federation of 1968 as it would
                        enable the Czechs to outvote the Slovaks.<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn27" n="26">Zdeněk Jičínský, “K volbě prezidenta” [On the Election of the

               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-22">The Civic Forum responded to the obstinacy of the parliament by calling mass
                        demonstrations in front of the Federal Assembly. At the same time it started
                        to speak of the Federal Assembly within the categories of sin and guilt. The
                        dismissal of MPs was to become the “most dignified and visible form of
                        repentance for the past inactivity of the Federal Assembly, not having
                        prevented the evil. The repentance of the MPs at the Federal Assembly may
                        thus be manifested by the swiftest possible election of the President.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn28" n="27">Suk, <hi rend="italic">Občanské

               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-23">Within the last days of 1989 the two parties eventually reached a temporary
                        compromise on the Constitutional Act on Co-optation of Deputies. It did not
                        include dismissals of deputies, and merely filled the seats vacated after a
                        series of resignations. Nevertheless, the Civic Forum continued to expect to
                        use the model of dismissal of MPs from 1969 after the election of the
                        President. Yet it did not mention the intention in public or to MPs. During
                        the meeting of officials of the Civic Forum and the Public Against Violence
                        on 22 December, Pavel Rychetský, a lawyer and member of the narrowest
                        leadership circle in the Civic Forum, explained further approach to his
                        Slovak partners: “It would not be appropriate for Dubček to be the only one
                        to become MP on Wednesday (28 December). He ought to be among at least ten
                        or twelve others so that it does not look inappropriate. We intend to sit
                        down with you [Public Against Violence] to go over the actual
                        reconstruction. We have put together – I think I can say it here – some kind
                        of a shooting list of MPs from the Czech lands who simply cannot remain in
                        their posts.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn29" n="28">Suk, <hi rend="italic">Občanské fórum</hi>, 263.</note> The first wave of co-optation was
                        thus not intended to change the proportion of votes in the Federal Assembly,
                        but to symbolically accompany Alexander Dubček to the post of the Chairman.
                        It was also to create a parliamentary clearway that would enable direct
                        influence of developments within. Co-optation of Zdeněk Jičínský played a
                        particular role. He was to become the main and, at the time, the only
                        representative of Civic Forum in the top ranks of the parliament. Zdeněk
                        Jičínský invited along, for support, Vladmír Mikule, the “king of the Czech
                        legal positivism,” who immediately became the Chairman of the pivotal
                        Constitutional-Legal Committee.<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn30" n="29">Zdeněk Jičínský, <hi rend="italic">Můj přítel Vladimír Mikule</hi> [My

                        tomorrow at nine in black suit – not the funeral one, but festive, to the
                        parliament, there will be the constitutional act and by-elections, the
                        ancillary ones. I had no decent suit, my salary was pitiful, and I was
                        barely able to provide for my family. So I went with my wife to a shopping
                        centre, bought a suit as required, to have something decent to put on.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn31" n="30">Cf. ICH, COH, coll. Interviews. An

                        Many authors and stakeholders in revolutions see Jičínskýʼs engagement in
                        co-optations as a revenge for the purges during normalisation. For instance,
                        the dissident and later Czech Prime Minister Petr Pithart suggests that
                        Jičínský “could not control himself” and repeatedly stated: “And now we
                        shall do them what they did to us after August.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn32" n="31">For Pithartʼs statement see Petr Pithart, “Proměny

                        Jičínskýʼs activities during the revolution and afterwards. The proposal for
                        co-optations falls not only within his wider contribution to the
                        post-Communist transformation of the parliament, but is also part of his own
                        specific vision of post-November changes that differed radically from that
                        of Havel. As the only one among revolutionary leaders, Zdeněk Jičínský was
                        wholly prepared, as a professional and specialist, for his political role of
                        the constitutional expert within the Civic Forum. His later right-wing
                        opponents saw him chiefly as the author of the 1960 Constitution. Yet his
                        activities in the November revolution benefitted far more from his
                        experience in political negotiations about federalisation of Czechoslovakia
                        in 1968. When drafting the bill on Czechoslovak federalisation that de facto
                        represented a new Constitution, Jičínský tested the opportunities and limits
                        of a compromise between the (Slovak) principle of sovereignty and the
                        (Czech) civic principle of equality of votes. He also had an opportunity to
                        test the narrow limits of Czech understanding of the Slovak issue. Finally,
                        a year later, he experienced himself the “restructuring” of the parliament
                        when forced to resign from both mandates and his seats were immediately
                        filled by co-optation. Shortly prior to November, Zdeněk Jičínský, the
                        author of many texts of Charter 77, together with other lawyers participated
                        in developing an alternative draft of the Constitution that was to be the
                        answer by the Opposition to the draft developed by the Government.<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn33" n="32">See ICH, COH, coll. Interviews. An

                        of his reform-minded Communist friends, he did not attempt to reform the
                        Communist Party. Yet his political and ideological world was deeply marked
                        by life experience of a reform Communist who fought the aesthetic-political
                        project of the late Stalinism. That gave rise to his scepticism about
                        revolutionary heroism, an emphasis on the “effect of time”, as much as his
                        concern about excessive power of an individual – the cult of
                        personality.<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn34" n="33">Cf. František

                        to be symbolically counterweighted by Alexander Dubček as a Slovak and
                        representative figure of 1968. To Jičínský, the reference to 1968 laid not
                        as much in the continuity with certain political stream, as much in the
                        continuity of a state sui iuris, a state that is free to run its affairs,
                        particularly the issues related to the relationship between the Czechs and
                        Slovaks. During the leadership negotiations at the Civic Forum Jičínský
                        repeatedly proposed Alexander Dubček for Presidency. He saw Havelʼs role to
                        be outside the official structures: one of a leader of the revolutionary

                        repeatedly vented his frustration about Jičínskýʼs tactics. In the 1992

                        rushed the coalition negotiations, by saying: “Zdeněk Jičínskýʼs opinion
                        convinced me in that I was right to proceed the way I did. For, whenever I
                        took his advice into account, the common denominator was always a
                        recommendation that something was to be delayed or not rushed; it had
                        adverse effect. Experience has taught me that it is best to do the opposite

                        was fast and dramatic. As opposed to the slow “Parliamentary time” that
                        draws from its very nature, Havelʼs fast “Presidential time” was not within
                        the intrinsic nature of the Presidential office, but its “tragic
                        enhancement”.<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn41" n="40">Šútovec, <hi rend="italic">Semióza ako politikum,</hi> 273.</note> Instead of
                        parliamentary democracy, which, as Jičínský argued, Havel never adopted as
                        his own, the President created a “Republic of friends” based on ethical and
                        aesthetic judgements, as much as on personal rather than institutional
                        ties.</p>
               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-28">Zdeněk Jičínský, as the defendant of “legal continuity with the Communist
                        régime” became number one enemy to the post-revolutionary fighters against
                        Communism. Yet more than legal continuity in terms of permanence or
                        inviolability of the legal system, Jičínský was more concerned about the
                        social and state continuity. He argued that, vis-à-vis the revolutionary
                        avalanche, legality stood as the “cultural method of power” needed for the
                        preservation of social cohesion. He was also mindful of preservation of the
                        continuity of state. Here he was guided by his experience of state existence
                        that could not be taken for granted. The continuity of state was based on a
                        political accord between the two national representatives, expressed at the
                        time in the act on Czechoslovak federation. The federalisation of 1968 was
                        thus not “merely administratively complex a method of totalitarian
                        governance”, as stated by Václav Havel at the Federal Assembly on 23 January
                        1990, but it was a manifestation of recognition of equality of the Slovak
                        people.<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn42" n="41">“Projev ve Federálním

                        with his proposal for co-optations and many other draft bills, proved that
                        he did not care about immutability of law. Instead, he was willing to
                        initiate deep changes in the legal system, though the changes had to occur
                        through a generally accepted procedure, i.e. within the constitutional
                        framework.</p>

                        institution that held the state together and guaranteed the legality of the
                        radical political changes. Apart from the constitutional legality, however,
                        the Federal Assembly also required revolutionary legitimacy to be supplied
                        by the co-optations. Other means of parliamentary legitimation that were
                        available – the extensive by-elections, or even the swift early elections –
                        would only jeopardise the role of the Federal Assembly as the only stable
                        institution standing strong to the “revolutionary avalanche.”</p>

               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-30">The path from the first to the second wave of co-optations did not prove
                        entirely smooth. On the one hand, there was the process of
                        “self-parliamentarisation” that accelerated within the Federal Assembly,
                        particularly in its presidium, which meant an awareness among MPs that they
                        held legislative power and responsibility. Apart from the election of Václav
                        Havel for Presidency which was a clear legitimisation of the mandates
                        acquired in the 1986 “elections”, an additional factor was, paradoxically,
                        the first wave of co-optations. That brought to the parliament some familiar
                        figures of the revolution, particularly Alexander Dubček.</p>

                        in to those moods, depression and manifest resignations on mandates, because
                        it is to be in our interest that this body is functional. It has to be in

                        growing self-confidence and “defiance” of the Federal Assembly, it was
                        agreed that the MPs would not be dismissed by their representative
                        assemblies, as had been proposed by Zdeněk Jičínský on 28 November (and by
                        the MPs from the Peopleʼs Party at the Federal Assembly on 21 December), but
                        by political parties on behalf of which the MPs concerned had been elected.
                        Non-partisan MPs were dismissed by the “relevant body” within the National
                        Front upon agreement with the Civic Forum or the Public Against Violence.
                        The very principle of co-optation required no further debate as it had
                        already been legalised by the Constitutional Act of 28 December. Further
                        agreement only concerned its extension to all other levels of representative
                        assemblies. The Communist Party had, for some time, been making it clear
                        that it had not insisted on retention of majority in the parliaments.
                        Moreover, the act gave it an opportunity to regain, at least for the time
                        being, control over its own, increasingly independent MPs.</p>
               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-33">The draft bill on dismissals of MPs was first debated in committees. Those
                        were the fora to which the MPs were accustomed to, even during the previous
                        régime, to table critical objections or proposals for amendments. Similarly
                        to the Communist era, the debate at the committees again largely
                        supplemented the absent plenary debate. The formulation of the bill that
                        enabled the dismissal of MPs who, “because of their hitherto activities do
                        not offer guarantees for the development of political democracy” was the
                        source of major indignation. For instance, an MP at the Committee for
                        Industry, Transport and Trade stated that it was unclear “what is the
                        measure to ascertain who does and who does not offer guarantees for
                        democracy ... How can those things be measured?”<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn46" n="45">Ibid.</note> All Committees that debated the bill
                        thus agreed that the second and dominant criterion for dismissal had to be
                        stated, i.e. political decision to replace significant proportion of the
                        Communist MPs by those from the Civic Forum. The final reading of the bill
                        thus contained a breakneck formulation that MPs might also be dismissed “in
                        the interest of a balanced distribution of political forces.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn47" n="46">APCR, FS-5, Prints, No.

                        deputies. They complained that political parties “were not familiar with how

                        political worlds) was concerned that “there are often people within the

                        co-optations. On the one hand, they themselves went through the
                        co-optational “cleansing”. On the other hand, the issues of national
                        committees fell within their powers. Whilst not a single critical voice was
                        raised in the Czech National Council, on 12 January 1990 the Slovak National
                        Council held an extensive, largely critical debate on the bill. Part of MPs
                        criticised the fact that the bill eliminated the representative nature of
                        the parliament. One of the MPs, a representative of the Slovak Union of
                        Women, pointed out that not a single woman was among the 22 co-opted
                        deputies for the Federal Assembly and that only a single woman was co-opted
                        in place of the three female MPs that stepped down. She argued that the main
                        reason behind this was the fact that interest groups were removed from the

                        forward and pro-Western, towards rapid economic transformation and

                        of co-optations, the dualism – provided it was ever functioning, operated in
                        reverse. The Slovak National Council was, despite everything, a national
                        parliament for the Slovak society, the public forum to debate the
                        substantial issues related to national life. It was already during Communism
                        that the Slovak National Council granted itself greater autonomy than its
                        Czech counterpart. It sometimes even brought critical voices in the plenary,
                        for instance on the issue of “triune constitution.” The co-optations thus
                        meant reduction of authority of the supreme national institution. That was
                        also the ground on which the Chairman of the Slovak National Council Rudolf
                        Schuster objected to them. The co-optations, however, were in particular
                        conflict with the self-definition of the Public Against Violence as a
                        consistent opposition to the previous régime; hence it was unwilling to be
                        “co-opted.” Whilst the largely Slovak doubts about co-optations did not meet
                        significant response in public media discourse or at street demonstrations,
                        it was at the federal parliament where the discordant voices could not be
                        ignored.</p>

                        achieve any political or media success. As Tomáš Zahradníček showed, the
                        revolution and the television as a medium preferred images of unmediated
                        power, full squares and a leader figure, instead of the slow, often chaotic
                        proceedings, tied by internal regulations, held by a few hundred elderly men

                        end. On Tuesday 23 January from 10am channel one of the Czech Television

                        alternated between shots of the numerous members of the presidium and the
                        view of the impressive plenary consisting of 350 MPs from both Houses. The
                        presidium of the Federal Assembly was seated under the quotation from the
                        Constitution: “All power in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic belongs to
                        the working people.” The ensemble was dominated by the figure of Alexander
                        Dubček. Sidelined to the post of the Chairman of the Federal Assembly, when
                        running the session, he seems utterly uncertain, even though he was guided
                        by a written script (the so called Presidials). Timothy Garton Ash described
                        the view of the plenary as follows: “The women with putty faces, cheap perms
                        and schoolmistress voices. The men in cheap suits, with hair swept straight
                        back from sweaty foreheads. The physiognomy of power for the last forty
                        years.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn64" n="63">Ash, <hi rend="italic">We The People,</hi> 111.</note> Among them gleamed generalsʼ

                        MPs who probably tried to keep an optical distance from their unexpected
                        company. The position of the cameras did not allow to capture the key part
                        of the plenary – the Slovak section of the House of Peoples, when the voting
                        machine got stuck. On the contrary, it enabled to record whispering among
                        the members of the presidium (Alexander Dubček: “Stanislav, what to do about
                        it now?”<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn65" n="64">Alexander Dubček turned to

                        The camera also regularly approached the guest gallery above the plenary
                        that hosted Frank Zappa with his television crew – he was allegedly shooting
                        an hour-long documentary about the Czechoslovak revolution (seemingly never
                        completed) for the Financial News Network.<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn66" n="65">Frank Zappa worked for the cable channel Financial News Network
                            for some time, first as guest (as commentator on the American music and

                            Soviet Union). Later he hosted his own show, the Frank Zappa’s Wild Wild
                            East. It seems that, for Zappa who unsuccessfully tried to do business
                            with the Soviet Union, the visit to Czechoslovakia in January 1990 was
                            essentially an attempt to establish business contacts. He thus had
                            Václav Havel appoint him Special Ambassador to the West on Trade,
                            Culture and Tourism. That led the US Secretary of State James Baker to
                            state wryly: “You can do business with the United States or you can do
                            business with Frank Zappa.” On the other side, to Václav Havel and other
                            post-dissent politicians the encounter with the prominent figures of the
                            Western alternative rock scene was a means to overcome the conflict
                            between their own “authentic” past and the contemporary role within the
                            political establishment and support to the neoliberal

                        Ján Riško advocated the parliamentʼs right to non-revolutionary momentum, to
                        its own parliamentary time: “We are here today to again adopt bills which we
                        had barely had a chance to read, not to speak of consulting them with our
                        voters. Yet we hear a voice from everywhere --- weʼve got to hurry, fast,
                        fast, fast. Someone is worried about missing something ... One cannot make
                        the laws in a hurry.” According to Riško, the Civic Forum followed the same
                        script as did the Communist Party in 1969 and it was using the same,
                        specifically Czechoslovak method devised to remove potential political
                        opponents in the parliament.</p>
               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-41">Riškoʼs speech triggered an hour-long unscheduled debate. The MPs were
                        competing to dismiss the Communist MP. All agreed on that Ján Riško ought to
                        be silent, for he was silent for twenty years. With the exception of a few
                        co-opted MPs, the objection applied to all existing MPs none of whom could
                        pride themselves in a daring speech to the plenary. Yet most of them
                        believed that they secured their right to speak by having consented to the
                        post-November developments. “The freedom to consent” was a right that the
                        MPs earned by conformity, particularly with the election of the President.
                        The “freedom of consent” thus perceived is similar to the understanding of
                        freedom by the Communist Party.<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn69" n="68">Cf.
                            Petr Fidelius, “<hi rend="italic">Řeč komunistické moci</hi>” [“The
                            Communist Power Talk”] (Praha: Triáda, 1998).</note> Nevertheless, the
                        Federal Assembly thus destined itself after November 1989 to its hitherto
                        status: one of an institution that is clad into constitutional clothes of
                        decisions adopted elsewhere. Even though parliaments, including those in
                        democracies, often play the same role and the parliament of the first
                        Czechoslovak Republic did largely the same, in this case even the right to
                        debate was being denied. Apart from the main line of criticism of Riškoʼs
                        speech, a number of additional side issues emerged. Zdeněk Jičínský, for
                        instance, argued that the presented bill cannot be compared with the
                        parliamentary purges of 1969, as other civil rights of MPs remain intact.
                        Unlike in the case of the MPs dismissed in 1969, “no one will prevent Mr
                        Riško to bid for his mandate in the free elections scheduled for June”
                        Jičínský stated. He thus indicated that he was aware of Riškoʼs dismissal
                        that had already been agreed, even though the bill had not yet been adopted.
                        Paradoxically and from purely formal perspective, the dismissal of MPs in
                        1969 was “cleaner” as the right to dismiss was bestowed upon the
                        parliaments, and not on political parties as was the case in 1990.</p>
               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-42">Another frequent theme in the criticism of Riškoʼs speech and in defence of
                        the dismissal of MPs was a claim that the “reconstruction of the parliament”
                        was a necessary step for “the political composition [of the parliament] to
                        ideally reflect the political compositions and mentality of the people in
                        our country.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn70" n="69">Address by Mr

                        Such demand was revolutionary indeed: it is ultimately more a rule than an
                        exception that the public atmosphere would not be in line with the
                        composition of a parliament. That is why elections are held after all.</p>
               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-43">After the debate Alexander Dubček, being evidently insecure, called the vote.
                        The bill was passed smoothly in the House of Peoples, with only nine MPs
                        abstaining. In the crucial House of Nations, however, nearly forty MPs were
                        absent. Thus, whilst the Czech section passed the bill, albeit with a narrow
                        margin, three MPs opposed it in the Slovak section (including Ján Riško),
                        and 22 others abstained. Thus the bill was not adopted. Alexander Dubček,
                        who chaired the session and the voting following the printed script, first
                        declared the bill adopted. Only after vocal objections from the Slovak
                        section, constantly apologising, he started to look for “legislators in the
                        know” who would be able to resolve the situation in which the Federal
                        Assembly found itself for the first time in its history. After a few
                        intermissions and procedural discussions<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn71" n="70">See further Suk, <hi rend="italic">Labyrintem revoluce,</hi>
                            289–290.</note> a Conciliation Committee was set up for the very first
                        time, to be chaired by Zdeněk Jičínský. It was to find a way out of the
                        conflict between the two Houses.</p>
               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-44">Prior to that, Václav Havel addressed the plenary of the Federal Assembly
                        with nearly a two-hour long speech.<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn72" n="71">“Projev ve Federálním shromáždění 23. ledna 1990” [Address to the
                            Federal Assembly on 23 January 1990], in <hi rend="italic">Spisy</hi>

                            150-163.</note> It was his first opportunity to address the parliament
                        as President. In particular, however, it was a chance to present his
                        political-aesthetic plans in the dramatic juxtaposition to the prop of the
                        Communist parliament and (mostly) Communist MPs. Havel informed the MPs, who
                        were taken aback and whose faith was just being decided behind the scenes in
                        the parliament, of the details of his intentions (about his request
                        presented to Sweden to return a part of the trophies of the Thirty-Year War,
                        about the “incredibly distasteful” bathrooms at the chateau Lány, or about
                        the new uniforms of the Castle Guards). His notes were addressed to the
                        television viewers rather than the MPs. In his address Havel did not forget
                        to remind the MPs that “it was the old era that raised you to your posts”.
                        He also very clearly suggested that he derived his authority from the
                        revolution (“the public to which I feel utmost responsibility”), and not
                        from the parliament. In conclusion, Havel famously proposed a change to the
                        names of the three republics, their coats of arms, names of armies and
                        suggested that he expected the parliament to promptly content to his
                        proposals. The Federal Assembly postponed the debate on Havelʼs proposals –
                        a decision which is often identified as the cause of the “hyphen war”.<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn73" n="72">The term “hyphen war” refers to a
                            long and complex conflict about the name of the common state in the
                            first half of 1990.</note> Co-optations were among the reasons why the
                        debate was postponed. Because of the resignation of nearly one half of MPs
                        “the short parliament” between its 22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> and 23rd
                        sessions (23 – 30 January) was unable to carry out even the essential
                        procedural tasks. The presidium of the House of Peoples could not reach a
                        quorum.</p>
               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-45">Shortly before 6pm, after the debate on a number of additional points, the
                        Houses reconvened to debate the bill on dismissal of MPs. Zdeněk Jičínský
                        reviewed the deliberations of the Conciliation Committee. He informed that
                        the failure to adopt the bill was caused by the discontent of independent
                        MPs with the formal procedure in debating the bill that was unrelated to the
                        content of the draft bill. He then appealed to the Slovak MPs who first
                        abstained, to assume a clear position either in support of or against the
                        bill. No one abstained in the subsequent voting, with only a single MP
                        voting against. The parliament did not yet have the voting equipment, what
                        was explicable given the hitherto method of voting. It is therefore
                        impossible to estimate the number of MPs voting for the bill. Television
                        footage shows that some MPs, such as Ján Riško, did not vote at all. The
                        smooth adoption of the bill in the second round of voting suggests that the
                        Slovak MPs did not try to block the bill, but tried to firmly protest
                        against the misuse of the parliament. They fought for the right of the
                        parliament to consent (procedurally accurately), the right to being taken at
                        least as seriously as was case of the Communist parliament and, eventually,
                        for the right of MPs to consider their hitherto public activities
                        meaningful. After the adoption of the bill on dismissal of the MPs the
                        agenda of the 22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> session was summarily
                        debated. The televised broadcast from the Federal Assembly closed with an
                        image of MPs from the House of People leaving the parliament forever, others
                        who might return in a week to elect over hundred and thirty new colleagues.
                        The sensitive microphones of the state Czechoslovak Television captured
                        their mutual farewells.</p>

               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-46">The co-optations significantly changed the status of the parliament in the
                        post-November distribution of power. The institute of roundtable talks
                        disintegrated and the parliament became the central (though not exclusive)
                        platform for political negotiations. The aforementioned process of
                        “self-parliamentarisation” has accelerated considerably, i.e. the
                        emancipation of the legislature vis-à-vis the executive power. The “hyphen
                        war” that broke out instantly after the co-optations was thus waged in the
                        parliament, and not behind the political scenes or on the street. The side
                        effect of the shift from roundtable talks to parliamentary debates resulted
                        in a deep plunge in the influence of small political parties within the
                        National Front: with their meek parliamentary fractions and mediocre
                        electoral perspectives, they could not compete with the far more numerous
                        and prospective parliamentary fractions of the Civic Forum and the Communist
                        Party. Together with the outer position of the parliament within the
                        structure of the power, the inner running of the Federal Assembly as an
                        institution changed as well. Though the co-optations changed nearly a half
                        of MPs, the key bodies of the Federal Assembly (the presidium, chairs of
                        committees) experienced far deeper change. The two thirds of members of the
                        presidium of the Federal Assembly have been changed; the presidiums of the
                        Houses have been changed altogether, and the roles of the chairs of the
                        committees have been changed by 85 percent.<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn74" n="73">Jana Reschová, “Nová politika s novými ľuďmi” [New Politics with

               </p>
               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-47">The speed of work at the parliament also rapidly increased as the legislature
                        convened far more often than under communism and debated far greater number
                        of bills. That is also related to yet another internal transformation – the
                        development of the rules of procedure appropriate for a parliament that was
                        no longer under the oversight of the Communist Party, but one that had to
                        itself regulate its internal disagreements. Even though the new rules of
                        procedure were only adopted in the subsequent parliamentary term, the change
                        in debating the bills followed soon after the co-optations. The initiative
                        presented by Vladimír Mikule proved particularly important. He achieved, <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>, that each amendment had to be first
                        discussed in the Constitutional-Legal Committee prior to being voted
                        on.<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn75" n="74">Jičínský, <hi rend="italic">Československý parlament</hi>, 91–92.</note> Parliamentary mandate
                        was no longer an occasional duty or status accessory, but full time job.
                        That also raised the issue of wages for the MPs. Political culture has
                        changed substantially. Instead of the perfect parliamentary machine of the
                        Communist era with disciplined deputies, pre-approved input and careful
                        choreographed sessions, the co-opted parliament was a picture of chaos,
                        improvisation and procedural hurdles.</p>
               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-48">Co-optations have been a decisive step on the path of the Federal Assembly
                        from the Communist parliament to the liberal one that only emerged after the
                        elections in June 1990. It was still the first step, as the vital regional
                        principle remained in place until the elections in June 1990 (i.e. the MPs
                        represented their constituency). It was also because the Civic Forum was
                        shaping itself as a representative body of all social strata without any
                        significant differentiation of political currents. It was only the
                        disintegration of the parliamentary fraction of the Civic Forum nearly a
                        year later brought the process to completion. By giving political parties
                        and movements an opportunity to choose new MPs, co-optations also
                        contributed to the introduction of the proportional electoral system and
                        created conditions for the emergence of strong party democracy.</p>
               <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-49">From the wider Central European perspective, the main consequences of the
                        co-optations in the Federal Assembly were the institutionalisation and
                        slowdown of the November revolution. The Velvet Revolution that proved
                        unique in post-Communist Europe for its pace, turned into “refolution”,<note place="foot" xml:id="ojs-130-ftn76" n="75">Ash, <hi rend="italic">We The
                                People,</hi> 14.</note> a hybrid between revolution and reform.
                        Co-optations, though a specifically Czechoslovak method, drew Czechoslovakia
                        closer to other countries of Eastern Europe. They created a new political
                        class and, at the same time, helped a number of “old structures” survive (if
                        only for short time): the political parties within the National Front and
                        some of its officials, the legal system of the Communist Czechoslovakia, the
                        constitutional system of 1968, and thus the common state of the Czechs and
                        Slovaks.</p>

                    zveznega parlamenta v obdobju 1989–1990</head>
            <docAuthor xml:id="ojs-130-docAuthor-3">Petr Roubal</docAuthor>
            <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-50">Češkoslovaški zvezni parlament, ki je bil ustanovljen leta 1969 v okviru
                    federalizacije Češkoslovaške, je v žametni revoluciji čez dvajset let odigral
                    pomembno in hkrati paradoksalno vlogo. V izpraznjenem oblastnem prostoru, ki ga
                    je v paniki ustvarila komunistična partija Češkoslovaške, je zvezni parlament
                    nenadoma postal ključna in edina institucija, ki bi lahko zagotovila mirno in
                    ustavno preoblikovanje političnega sistema. Opozicijski gibanji (češki
                    Državljanski forum in slovaška Javnost proti nasilju) sta sprejeli komunistično
                    ustavo kot podlago za preoblikovanje, ustavo pa je bilo mogoče spremeniti samo
                    prek zveznega parlamenta.</p>
            <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-51">Ta strategija ni imela verodostojne alternative, saj je imel velik del
                    komunistične in pokomunistične slovaške elite ustavo in zvezni parlament za
                    zgodovinska dosežka. Druge možnosti, na primer vrnitev k češkoslovaški ustavi iz
                    leta 1920, so bile za Slovake popolnoma nesprejemljive. Težava je bila v tem, da
                    so bili poslanci zveznega parlamenta leta 1986 izvoljeni na volitvah v
                    komunističnem slogu, zato jih družba ni imela za legitimne poslance. Zdeněk
                    Jičínský, reformistični komunist, eden od avtorjev ustavnih sprememb iz leta
                    1968 in vodilni ustavni strokovnjak Državljanskega foruma, se je domislil
                    koncepta »kooptacij«. Nekateri poslanci naj bi odstopili ali bi jih odpoklical
                    parlament, ki bi potem izvolil nove člane iz vrst opozicijskih gibanj.</p>
            <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-52">To bi omogočilo odlog volitev, utrdilo verodostojnost zveznega parlamenta in
                    ohranilo njegovo vlogo stabilne institucije v nemirnem revolucionarnem obdobju.
                    Ta primer ni bil edinstven v sodobni češki zgodovini, v kateri volitve nikoli
                    niso bile uporabljene kot rešitev za politično krizo. Dejansko je bila za zgled
                    čistka novoustanovljenega zveznega parlamenta iz leta 1969 – številni poslanci,
                    ki so bili odstranjeni v tem procesu (predvsem Aleksander Dubček), so se čez
                    dvajset let vrnili v parlament s pomočjo pravzaprav identične zakonodaje.
                    »Kooptacije«, ki so bile na Češkoslovaškem sicer edinstvene, so bile del širšega
                    pojava ustavnih improvizacij v srednji in vzhodni Evropi, kjer so se vse države
                    spopadale s kompleksno ustavno zapuščino komunistične dobe.</p>
            <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-53">Ta študija je del širšega raziskovalnega projekta o zveznem parlamentu v obdobju
                    1989–1992, ki proučuje mehanizme »samoparlamentarizacije«, tj. procesa
                    postopnega osvobajanja zakonodajnega telesa od izvršne oblasti. Študija ima tri
                    temeljne cilje. Prvič, nadaljuje raziskovanje revolucionarnih sprememb ob koncu
                    leta 1989 in na začetku leta 1990 v smeri , katere začetnik je Jiří Suk, ter z
                    uporabo istih metod in virov (prepisov pogajanj gibanja Državljanski forum,
                    arhivov Državljanskega foruma) proučuje enega od stranskih hodnikov »labirinta
                    revolucije«. Veliko razlagalcev meni, da so »kooptacije« izvirni greh, iz
                    katerega so izšle številne tegobe pokomunistične preobrazbe v devetdesetih letih
                    20. stoletja. Zato je vredno raziskati, kako so se sprejemale odločitve in ali
                    so bile na voljo tudi verodostojne alternative. Drugič, sama tematika zveznega
                    parlamenta in viri, ki jih ustvaril (zapisniki plenarnih sej, parlamentarnih
                    odborov, predsedstva ali pogovorov s poslanci), nam omogočajo vpogled v žametno
                    revolucijo s perspektive marginaliziranih in poraženih udeležencev.</p>
            <p xml:id="ojs-130-p-54">Boj za nadzor nad parlamentom razkriva dva različna pogleda na spremembe:
                    konceptu moralne in estetske revolucije Václava Havla , ki bi uničila vse grdo
                    in zlo, se je zoperstavil reformni program »paragrafske revolucije« , ki ga je
                    zagovarjal Zdeněk Jičínský ob globokem dvomu v sposobnosti množice in njenih
                    voditeljev. Šlo je za trk dveh političnih obdobij: dinamičnega obdobja
                    revolucije in počasnega premikanja parlamentarne demokracije. Opazujemo lahko
                    tudi svetovni nazor poražencev, tj. parlamentarnih poslancev, ki niso želeli, da
                    jih revolucionarna gibanja zgolj izkoristijo in zavržejo, ampak so hoteli biti
                    del politične preobrazbe. Bojevali so se za pravico, ki jim jo je omogočal celo
                    komunistični režim – pravico do »strinjanja«. To je bilo očitno predvsem med
                    nenavadno parlamentarno razpravo o »kooptaciji«, ki se je nanašala na vprašanje,
                    ali naj parlament odvzame sedež več kot sto svojim poslancem. Prvič v svoji
                    zgodovini zvezni parlament ni sprejel zakona, vendar si je pod pritiskom hitro
                    premislil. Televizija je javno prenašala to razpravo, katere absurdnost je
                    dodatno poudaril nepričakovan nastop zunanjih obiskovalcev: predstavnikov

                    Václava Havla, ki ga je ta parlament nedavno izvolil za predsednika in je s
                    svojim govorom podžgal tako imenovani »spor zaradi vezaja«, in Franka Zappe na
