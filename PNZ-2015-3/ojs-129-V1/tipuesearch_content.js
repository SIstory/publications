Traditional historiographical works on institutions used to describe the most easily visible parts. In case of parliaments, they would refer to the most evident archival traces such as the foundation of the body, its composition, official actors and their speeches, the legislation passed etc. The so called new institutionalism can be understood as a reaction to the development in social sciences turning the researcher’s attention away from the central to less visible actors and processes. Descriptions of organizations began to focus on practices, habits, values and myths generally accepted and further transferred by institutions. Parliaments are thus often seen as relatively stable structures with established social norms, methods of bargaining and expertise. These seem to sooner or later overwhelm every newcomer and make him or her adapt to the norms and start practising them as well. We will be able to trace this process during the régime change and demonstrate some interesting continuities between the socialist, revolutionary and liberal democratic parliaments within the Federal Assembly.", "tags": "", "loc": "ojs-129-article.html#ojs-129-p-14" },

First, demonstrations and protests traditionally centred round the statue of St Wenceslas, which had been separated from the parliament’s building by a busy crossroad and an urban motorway constructed in the late 1970. Second, the demonstrators rather turned their attention to the organs of the Communist Party and the media headquarters, by which they assessed the parliament’s significance in the political system quite appropriately, as it seemed.

It is certainly true that the Czechoslovak Communist Party was extremely reluctant as it came to transferring Mikhail Gorbachev’s perestroika and glasnost from the Soviet Union. For Czechoslovak leaders, these policies fatefully resembled the Prague Spring reforms, the suppression of which brought them to power. But reforms in general were perceived as necessary, and the federal parliament became one of the few official political arenas where the principles of perestroika were to be tested and presented. The committees and chambers found themselves under pressure exerted by the government: the parliamentary bodies were expected to pass the drafts of economic reform regulations quickly and smoothly, while at the same time showing “a spirit of openness”. Pressure also came from the public: members of parliament were bound to participate at numerous meetings in their constituencies, and in these years, they met immediate critique wherever they showed up. See e.g. “Interview of Josef Bartončík, Brno, Dec. 3, 2012,” in Sbírka rozhovorů s bývalými poslanci Federálního shromáždění , ed.

The Communist Party Central Committee also pressed on resignation on nine deputies who were either abroad at diplomatic postings or had been ill for a long time.

Their composition was no longer derived purely from party electoral support: the bodies needed to mirror the society in a more literal sense. This system of the so called descriptive representation produced parliaments consisting of deputies who reflected the society’s occupation, gender, ethnic and age structure to a considerable extent – as opposed to mere political preference expressed by bourgeois parliaments.

Although as was shown previously, the actual power was difficult to measure, making a professional impression became a crucial imperative in the late state-socialism. The Communist Party evaluators used to express it through the requirements of “thorough preparation”, “successful coordination” of speeches and “high quality” of the sessions. See e.g. speech by Richard Nejezchleb, Minutes of the Defence and Security Committee, 4th meeting, Feb. 4, 1987 (APCR, FA-5). Cf. speech by Dalibor Hanes, Minutes of the Presidium, 2nd meeting, June 24, 1986 (APCR, FA-5). The interviews of MPs of the time show what a key element of their collective identity it was. For them, the main disillusionment associated with the 1989 revolution was exactly the disruption of this professionalism producing chaos and a lack of awareness of procedure and of good manners. See e.g. “Interview of Štefánia Michalková, Bratislava, Nov. 15, 2011,” in Gjuričová, Sbírka rozhovorů.", "tags": "", "loc": "ojs-129-article.html#ojs-129-p-31" },

Approximately half of the deputies were replaced by new ones through co-opting in January1990. The first free elections in June changed the parliament painstakingly once again: three quarters of the elected deputies were newcomers. The continuity of parliamentary work – which involved immense legislative tasks of re-introducing democratic procedures in state administration as well as numerous elements of retribution – was more or less provided by the parliament’s administration, the Federal Assembly Office. Historical legitimacies made things even more complicated: first, employees expelled from the administration after 1968 were accepted back, and then, if things were not going well, conspiracy by the Communist Secret Service was declared to be the reason and alleged collaborators of the Secret Service found among the employees. The revolutionary professionalism was therefore a remarkable mix of old and new, skilled and inexperienced, and of victims of retribution and new, supposedly democracy-protecting purges.", "tags": "", "loc": "ojs-129-article.html#ojs-129-p-32" },
{ "title": "Coming to (a Short) Life", "text": "The question of formal professionalization of the highly time-consuming parliamentary occupation had been discussed since the beginning of 1990, but was seriously solved only after the summer general election. Being a deputy became a regular paid job. The salary that the parlamentarians approved for themselves was about three times the usual wage. This became one of the first income inequalities that the post-Communist public was exposed to Act No. 304/1990 Col., on salary and reimbursement of expenses of deputies of the Federal Assembly. For figures concerning the income see e.g. “Czech Statistical Office,” accessed October 30, 2015, http://csugeo.i-server.cz/csu/dyngrafy.nsf/graf/mzdy_1960_ . and caused a storm of criticism in the media.

{ "title": "Coming to (a Short) Life", "text": "There was yet another paradox. While the public and the media expressed their expectation from the parliament to do a professional job for a professional salary, on the other hand, specific anti-professional ethic was widely shared. In this period, it seemed that in order to cut the link with the Communist era, the political sphere needed people with no political experience, leadership or legal education, people who do not wish to become politicians, but are willing to temporarily sacrifice themselves for the good of others. This approach was very close to the prevailing dissident rhetoric embodied by Václav Havel. But it became one of the decisive factors in the process of disintegration of the revolutionary catch-all movements. In the new parliamentary term, there was a completely new set of skills to acquire. Clubs organized along the immature electoral lists of wide anti-Communist movements began to fall apart in real time at the Federal Assembly meetings as of 1990 and re-organize into a number of political fractions. The segment of post-socialist parliamentary élite that was building up political parties worshipped new professionalism by which it openly protested against the dissident political and historical legitimacy-based amateurism.

While the Czech post-socialist activists relied upon the federal level to bring them a long-term political perspective, the Slovak leaders opted for sub-federal institutions of the Slovak Republic in Bratislava. Being kicked-up to the federal parliament in Prague was perceived as risky by Slovak politicians. Because of long sessions in Prague, they grew isolated from Slovak politics which were going through a dramatic transformation. See e.g. Gabriela Rothmayerová, Zo zápisníka poslankyne (Bratislava: Perex, 1992), 36. In the Slovak society, there was also widespread distrust to the so called “federal” Slovaks based in Prague. And no wonder the Czech MPs felt distant from their Slovak counterparts who showed constant dissatisfaction with the functioning of the federal system and who used parliamentary procedure pragmatically to push through their partial Slovak interests. The Czech MPs said they were identified with the federal state, but, as will be further explained, even in this respect, reality proved to be more complicated.", "tags": "", "loc": "ojs-129-article.html#ojs-129-p-35" },

For several weeks the problem seemed to lie in the different position of the Civic Forum vs. the Slovak Public Against Violence within their respective publics and a much easier incorporation of former socialist elites in Slovakia.
