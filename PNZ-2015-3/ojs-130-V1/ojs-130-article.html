oxymoron. The leaders of the revolution in 1989 were aware that it was impossible to mobilise masses, improvise and keep on surprising the opponent and, at the same time, remain democrats. “We, who fight for democracy, cannot be democrats,” Timothy Garton Ash thus paraphrased Brecht when characterising the strategy of the Civic Forum.<span id="ojs-130-ftn3_return"><a class="notelink" title="Timothy Garton Ash, We The People: The Revolution of 89 Witnessed in Warsaw, Budapest, Berlin &amp; Prague (London: Penguin Books, 1990), 89." href="#ojs-130-ftn3"><sup>2</sup></a></span> The revolutionariesʼ dilemma in 1989 was not new and, in different form, is present within every modern revolution. In case of anti-Communist revolutions, however, an additional fact played a role: the old régimes were equipped with formally democratic constitutions and elected institutions. Moreover, with the disintegration of the power of Communist Parties, the Communist constitutions and parliaments were often the only means to hold the supranational states together. Furthermore, the Opposition had played, for some time, a peculiar game with the state when pretending to be taking seriously the formal constitutionality and democratic nature of the Communist régime and addressing its protests to the Federal Assembly or the Federal Government, instead of the Party bodies. Naturally, the constitutional institutions responded by using police repressions.<span id="ojs-130-ftn4_return"><a class="notelink" title="Cf. ICH, COH, collection Interviews. An interview with Dana Němcová, Prague, March 12, 2012." href="#ojs-130-ftn4"><sup>3</sup></a></span> The revolutions of 1989 thus had to be (and, at the same time, could not be) not merely democratic, but also constitutionally correct. This political contradiction led to constitutional improvisations across Eastern Europe. In Czechoslovakia the improvisations assumed a particularly imaginative shape in co-optations to parliamentary and other elected institutions in December 1989 and January 1990.</p><p id="ojs-130-p-11"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Legally, co-optation means an extension of the number of members of an institution by electing additional members. Sociologically, then, co-optation means integration of a marginal Opposition group into the mainstream. In Czechoslovakia, co-optation was used for all three parliaments and national committees following a proposal by Zdeněk Jičínský, constitutional specialist and dissident, based on roundtable political accords of the second half of December 1989 and early January 1990. Co-optations were to serve as expedient means to remove politically compromised individuals from the representative assemblies and to replace them with members of the two revolutionary movements – the Civic Forum and the Public Against Violence. It thus entailed two intertwined processes of dismissal and co-optation of deputies. The politically pivotal co-optations to the Federal Assembly were exercised in two waves. First, on 28 December 1989, a day before the Presidential election of Václav Havel, over twenty MPs were co-opted including Alexander Dubček who was instantly elected Chairman of the Federal Assembly. Shortly after the dramatic adoption of the bill on the dismissal of deputies, early January 1990 saw the second wave of co-optations that was far more extensive and introduced over 130 additional MPs to the Federal Assembly. The change (officially termed reconstruction) of both national councils and national committees in larger cities proved equally radical. Whilst the co-optations were generally accepted in the Czech lands as a pragatic solution, they faced (ineffective) resistance in Slovakia not merely among Communist deputies, but also within the Opposition.</p><p id="ojs-130-p-12"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>The following analysis of co-optations is part of a wider research into the Federal Assembly in 1989–1992 that explores the mechanisms of “self-parliamentarisation”, a process of gradual emancipation of legislative vis-à-vis executive power. The study has three objectives. First, it follows upon the work by Jiří Suk on the revolutionary months at the break of 1989 and 1990.<span id="ojs-130-ftn5_return"><a class="notelink" title="Cf. e.g. Jiří Suk, “Czechoslovakia in 1989: Causes, Results, and Conceptual Changes,” in Revolutions of 1989. A Handbook, ed. Wolfgang Mueller et. al.…" href="#ojs-130-ftn5"><sup>4</sup></a></span> Using similar methodologies and sources (the archive of the Civic Forum) the study attempts to explore one of the side corridors of the “labyrinth of revolution”. Co-optations are often deemed to be “the ancestral sin” at the beginning of many subsequent failures in the 1990s. Hence it is worth exploring what led to the situation and their possible alternatives. Second, the very topic of the Federal Assembly and the sources it generates (verbatim transcripts of plenary debates, debates in committees and at the presidium, as well as interviews with former MPs) offer an additional opportunity to approach the revolution of November 1989 from the perspective of the marginalised or defeated stakeholders. In contrast with Havelʼs vision of moral and aesthetic revolution that destroys all dire and ugly, the struggle for the dominance in the parliament sheds light on the reform vision of an “articled revolution”<span id="ojs-130-ftn6_return"><a class="notelink" title="Valtr Komárek, “Děkujeme, přijďte” [Thank You, Do Come], in Pocta Zdeňku Jičínskému k 80. narozeninám [Festschrift for Zdeněk Jičínský on his 80th Bir…" href="#ojs-130-ftn6"><sup>5</sup></a></span> coined by Zdeněk Jičínský with his deep-rooted scepticism about the genius of a mass and its leaders. This brings together two political times: the dynamic time of the revolution against the dragging time of parliamentary democracy. This is also the ideological world of those defeated, the MPs who did not want to be merely used and discarded by the Civic Forum , but to be part of the changes, fighting for their right to consent, to which they were entitled even under the Communist régime.</p></div><div class="subchapter" id="ojs-130-articel-sub02"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.2. </span><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="ojs-130-head-7">Cooptation in historical and regional context</span></h3><p id="ojs-130-p-13"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>Co-optations fall within a particular Czech political tradition under which elections were never used in key historical junctures to achieve new legitimacy. In 1918, at the time of the foundation of Czechoslovakia, the National Committee and subsequently the National Assembly were established as revolutionary bodies of political parties. They bore no political continuity with land assemblies and the Imperial Council. After Munich the change in geographical and political map was manifested in the so called short parliament where members from the occupied regions lost mandates, as did subsequently the members from the Communist Party. After the war the main political parties recognised the continuity of Presidential office, but not that of the parliament. The interim national assembly was thus called by the President by decree. Even though the parties were to again delegate their deputies, the post-war developments have brought a new understanding of parliament not as part of the division of power, but as the supreme constituent of self-government.<span id="ojs-130-ftn7_return"><a class="notelink" title="Jan Dobeš, Národní shromáždění v letech 1945-1948 [The National Assembly in 1945–1948] (PhD diss., Charles University, 2010)." href="#ojs-130-ftn7"><sup>6</sup></a></span> The discontinuity proved to be also personal: merely ten percent of the former MPs sat in the Interim National Assembly.<span id="ojs-130-ftn8_return"><a class="notelink" title="Michal Pehr, “Československý parlament po druhé světové válce” [The Czechoslovak Parliament after World War II], in Parlament v čase změny – případové…" href="#ojs-130-ftn8"><sup>7</sup></a></span> In February 1948 the Constitutional National Assembly did not play any significant role. Afterwards the parliamentary Action Committee swiftly neutralised non-Communist MPs using a combination of pressure and incentives (a number of them engaged actively in the cleansing within their own parties). Until the May 1948 elections no MP was formally stripped of mandate, though some had resigned, ten were arrested and over thirty had emigrated.</p><p id="ojs-130-p-14"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>In 1968, during the debates on federalisation, the Czech National Council was established as the counterweight to the Slovak National Council.<span id="ojs-130-ftn9_return"><a class="notelink" title="Constitutional act on the preparation of federal constitution of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (77/1968 Coll.)." href="#ojs-130-ftn9"><sup>8</sup></a></span> In July the National Assembly elected 150 MPs to the Czech National Council from its midst and from among the “notables in the Czech public life” nominated by the National Front.<span id="ojs-130-ftn10_return"><a class="notelink" title="Zdeněk Jičínský, Vznik České národní rady v době pražského jara 1968 a její působení do podzimu 1969 [The Emergence of the Czech Nation Council during…" href="#ojs-130-ftn10"><sup>9</sup></a></span> The Constitutional Act on Czechoslovak Federation from October 1968 stipulated that the Czech National Council would be extended to 200 deputies by co-optation. The MPs for the newly formed House of Nations of the Federal Assembly would also be elected from its midst.<span id="ojs-130-ftn11_return"><a class="notelink" title="Articles 146 and 147 of the Constitutional Act on Czechoslovak Federation (143/1968 Coll.)." href="#ojs-130-ftn11"><sup>10</sup></a></span> Finally, the Constitutional Act No 117/1969 Coll. again extended the term of parliamentary mandate from the standard four years to a total of seven. Particularly, however, it enabled cleansing within the parliaments. The Act empowered representative assemblies to strip their MPs of a mandate, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">inter alia</span> because “his or her activity harms the politics of the National Front.” By the 1971 elections, about one quarter of MPs in the Federal Assembly were thus replaced along with nearly one half of deputies in the Czech National Council. The Council, due to the date of its foundation during the hot summer of the Prague Spring, exerted greater resistance to the post-August leadership. All changes derived formally from the mandate, albeit quite dubious, arising from the last elections to the National Assembly in 1964. For instance, Zdeněk Jičínský, the author of the post-November co-optation, first served as MP in the Czech National Council and later also in the Federal Assembly, only to lose both mandates a year later: the process ensued without – even formal – voter involvement.</p><p id="ojs-130-p-15"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>The Czechoslovak model of co-optations was not used during the fall of Communism in any of the countries within the Soviet bloc. Yet all of them (with the exception of Romania), faced quite similar structural issue: how to deal with the constitutional legacy of Communism, particularly the legislative power of the parliament.<span id="ojs-130-ftn12_return"><a class="notelink" title="On Communist parliaments in the Soviet bloc see Daniel Nelson and Stephen White, Communist Legislatures in Comparative Perspective (New York: State Un…" href="#ojs-130-ftn12"><sup>11</sup></a></span> When the old régime fell, all countries within the former Soviet bloc had legislatures constructed upon the model of the Stalinist constitution of 1936 (although virtually all of them had been transformed by major constitutional changes in the 1970s and 1980s). Those parliaments were mostly “elected” in the early days of perestroika. The reformist or revolutionary élites had to raise a question whether a Communist parliament is actually a parliament and what the consequences are of such a query. Reformers, revolutionaries and conservatives included, to varying degrees, parliaments in their strategies, and parliamentary officials sought their place on the newly emerging political map. Year 1989 thus has not entailed as much a “return to democracy”, and certainly not in its interwar shape, but adaptation of “socialist democracy” and its constitutionalism to the context of open society. Similarly to the study of post-Communist nationalism, this paper also refutes the “freezer” thesis which claims that Communism merely froze ethnic conflicts that resurfaced during the political meltdown.<span id="ojs-130-ftn13_return"><a class="notelink" title="Cf. e.g. Katherine Verdery, National Ideology Under Socialism: Identity and Cultural Politics in Ceausescu's Romania (Berkeley: University of Californ…" href="#ojs-130-ftn13"><sup>12</sup></a></span> Similarly to nationalism, Communism not merely preserved, but mainly created and constituted political institutions. Additionally, Communist parliaments in the constituent republics in federal states were able to become (and often became indeed) the main instrument for the constitution of nation states. Similarly to disintegration, Communist parliament played an important role in the German unification. The East German <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Volkskammer</span> that gained new legitimacy by the hastily called early elections in March 1990, proved to be a pivotal institution in the process of German unification.<span id="ojs-130-ftn14_return"><a class="notelink" title="Werner J.

The Opposition also ignored it at first, adressing its demands to the Communist Party and the Federal Government. It was Zdeněk Jičínský who helped the demand for the “reconstruction” of the Federal Assembly to be tabled as early as at the second talk between the Civic Forum and Prime Minister Adamec at the Government Presidium on 28 November. Jičínský proposed a constitutional bill on dismissal and co-optation of MPs to be adopted along with the abolition of the leading role of the Communist Party:</p><blockquote id="ojs-130-quote-1">“...deputies in the Federal Assembly, the Czech National Council and the Slovak National Council, and representative assemblies at all levels, who compromised their parliamentary pledge and neglected the will and interests of the people, may be dismissed from their posts by the representative assembly which they are members of.

Just a day after the general strike, the Civic Forum did not yet have any ambition to enter the government, moreover to serve at the Federal Assembly. At the time Jičínskýʼs proposal for co-optations did not lead, to political regrouping of the parliament, but rather to its cleansing. The aim was to cleanse the parliament and to retain it operability at the same time. Jičínskýʼs erudition was manifested in the fact that he realised well before anyone else among the leaders of the Civic Forum, the risk of spontaneous pressure on resignations of MPs that would end up blocking the parliament.<span id="ojs-130-ftn16_return"><a class="notelink" title="Zdeněk Jičínský took part in, inter alia, drafting the Czechoslovak Constitution of 1960, and the Constitutional Act of 1968." href="#ojs-130-ftn16"><sup>15</sup></a></span> The issue was made even graver as the Civic Forum called from the outset for swift resignation of the President: it was the Federal Assembly to take over some of his powers.<span id="ojs-130-ftn17_return"><a class="notelink" title="Article 58 para. 6 of the Constitutional Act on Czechoslovak Federation 143/1968 Coll." href="#ojs-130-ftn17"><sup>16</sup></a></span></p><p id="ojs-130-p-18"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Jičínskýʼs proposal was not the only means of cleansing the representative corps. The electoral act from 1971 allowed for dismissal of deputies. A number of local activists from within the Opposition hoped to use the instrument.<span id="ojs-130-ftn18_return"><a class="notelink" title="James Krapfl, Revolution with a Human Face: Politics, Culture, and Community in Czechoslovakia, 1989–1992 (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2013), 16…" href="#ojs-130-ftn18"><sup>17</sup></a></span> The Civic Forum was also able to mobilise the public to exert sufficient pressure upon individual MPs to resign willingly. The situation faced by the deputies, particularly those who did not represent the central institutions of power, but were to represent the society (regionally, professionally, in terms of age and gender) was unenviable. The Communist régime used the deputies as one of the means to communicate with the public and to control public criticism. The deputies, as members of the Federal Assembly, were quite well known within their local context: the public did not perceive them as its “representatives”, but those of the régime. At regular meetings with voters in their local constituencies particularly during the late perestroika, they had to to listen to criticism of the failing régime without having had any opportunity to affect the situation. The deputies had no power during Communism, the less so during the revolution, hence they lacked political backing as well.<span id="ojs-130-ftn19_return"><a class="notelink" title="Adéla Gjuričová, “Profesionalizace parlamentů před a po Listopadu” [Professionalisation of Parliaments prior and after November] (paper presented at t…" href="#ojs-130-ftn19"><sup>18</sup></a></span> The Civic Forum did take it into account. In a debate on how to make the MPs to elect Václav Havel for President, one of the key activists of the Civic Forum stated that there was no danger of any resistance on their part: “Such person has neighbours, lives in a neighbourhood, and has relatives ...”<span id="ojs-130-ftn20_return"><a class="notelink" title="Jiří Suk, “K prosazení kandidatury Václava Havla na úřad prezidenta v prosinci 1989: Dokumenty a svědectví” [On Getting Through the Václav Havel Presi…" href="#ojs-130-ftn20"><sup>19</sup></a></span></p><p id="ojs-130-p-19"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>The issue, however, was that the Opposition did not need a “pure” parliament, but an operational one. Following the dismissal of MPs, the vacated seats had to be filled again. Constitutional Acts were adopted by a three-quarter majority of <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">all</span> MPs, not merely of those present. Therefore, in combination with the ban on majorisation,<span id="ojs-130-ftn21_return"><a class="notelink" title="The “minority veto” protected the Slovak MPs from being outvoted by their more numerous Czech counterparts." href="#ojs-130-ftn21"><sup>20</sup></a></span> an absence of 31 MPs in either the Czech of Slovak section of the House of Nations was enough to curb adoption of a Constitutional Act. The electoral law at the time allowed for by-elections, whilst also accounting for the possibility of choosing from a number of candidates. Yet by-elections, similarly to direct election of the President, were in conflict with “partial mobilisation” used by the Civic Forum to successfully marginalise its political competitors. The Civic Forum was the only one to manage to dominate public urban space and, in the free elections, it faced unnecessary competition. In a dispute with Zdeněk Jičínský over whether Havelʼs candidacy enjoyed broad public support, Václav Benda, the key figure of the Catholic Opposition, put the point accurately: “We are not dealing here as much of with some vague opinion of broad masses. In this particular situation it is the active masses who decide.”<span id="ojs-130-ftn22_return"><a class="notelink" title="Jiří Suk, Občanské fórum, listopad-prosinec 1989, 2. díl – dokumenty [Civic Forum, November–December 1992, volume 2: Documents] (Praha, Brno: Doplněk,…" href="#ojs-130-ftn22"><sup>21</sup></a></span></p><p id="ojs-130-p-20"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>The leaders of the Civic Forum realised the significance of the Federal Assembly on the night of 5 December, at the point when they decided to take over key Ministries and that Havel would be running for Presidency.<span id="ojs-130-ftn23_return"><a class="notelink" title="Suk, Občanské fórum, 96." href="#ojs-130-ftn23"><sup>22</sup></a></span> Václav Havel, in his then frequently quoted statement, referred to the Federal Assembly as to a “minor problem” that “still has to elect somebody here and there or has to adopt something”.<span id="ojs-130-ftn24_return"><a class="notelink" title="Suk, Občanské fórum, 98." href="#ojs-130-ftn24"><sup>23</sup></a></span> The statement shows that Havel was quite content with the “rubber-stamping” nature of the then Federal Assembly.

Petr Pithart summarised the uncertainty quite well: “What was agreed yesterday is one thing, certainly. The other matter is how to arrange for the people in the parliament to accept it. Because the Party will only tell them two more things: To go to hell and to elect Vašek Havel. And they will be casting secret vote! I am not certain whether these two instructions might prove mutually contradictory. No one can force and check on them.”<span id="ojs-130-ftn26_return"><a class="notelink" title="Suk, Občanské fórum, 197." href="#ojs-130-ftn26"><sup>25</sup></a></span></p><p id="ojs-130-p-21"><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>The Civic Forum soon came to realise that, not only did it not know how to make the Federal Assembly elect Václav Havel to Presidency, but also that it had been unable to prevent the other side from using it. During the second roundtable talks on 11 December, Vasil Mohorita surprised the Civic Forum when he announced that he would propose to the Federal Assembly a change of the Constitution in order to introduce direct election of the President. The Communist Party thus took over the initiative for a while and put the Civic Forum in a paradoxical situation of a defender of Communist constitutionalism and opponent of direct democracy. The Communist Party showed that it was also able to reach for “revolutionary” methods. As Zdeněk Jičínský emphasised in his response to the proposal, direct election of the President would not only be in conflict with the existing constitutional tradition of parliamentary democracy, but would be in utter conflict with the spirit of the Constitutional Act on Federation of 1968 as it would enable the Czechs to outvote the Slovaks.<span id="ojs-130-ftn27_return"><a class="notelink" title="Zdeněk Jičínský, “K volbě prezidenta” [On the Election of the President], Svobodné slovo, December 19, 1989, 3.

At the same time it started to speak of the Federal Assembly within the categories of sin and guilt. The dismissal of MPs was to become the “most dignified and visible form of repentance for the past inactivity of the Federal Assembly, not having prevented the evil. The repentance of the MPs at the Federal Assembly may thus be manifested by the swiftest possible election of the President.”<span id="ojs-130-ftn28_return"><a class="notelink" title="Suk, Občanské fórum, 230." href="#ojs-130-ftn28"><sup>27</sup></a></span></p><p id="ojs-130-p-23"><span class="numberParagraph">8</span>Within the last days of 1989 the two parties eventually reached a temporary compromise on the Constitutional Act on Co-optation of Deputies. It did not include dismissals of deputies, and merely filled the seats vacated after a series of resignations. Nevertheless, the Civic Forum continued to expect to use the model of dismissal of MPs from 1969 after the election of the President. Yet it did not mention the intention in public or to MPs. During the meeting of officials of the Civic Forum and the Public Against Violence on 22 December, Pavel Rychetský, a lawyer and member of the narrowest leadership circle in the Civic Forum, explained further approach to his Slovak partners: “It would not be appropriate for Dubček to be the only one to become MP on Wednesday (28 December). He ought to be among at least ten or twelve others so that it does not look inappropriate. We intend to sit down with you [Public Against Violence] to go over the actual reconstruction.

It was also to create a parliamentary clearway that would enable direct influence of developments within. Co-optation of Zdeněk Jičínský played a particular role. He was to become the main and, at the time, the only representative of Civic Forum in the top ranks of the parliament. Zdeněk Jičínský invited along, for support, Vladmír Mikule, the “king of the Czech legal positivism,” who immediately became the Chairman of the pivotal Constitutional-Legal Committee.<span id="ojs-130-ftn30_return"><a class="notelink" title="Zdeněk Jičínský, Můj přítel Vladimír Mikule [My Friend Vladimír Mikule], in Pocta doc.

Many authors and stakeholders in revolutions see Jičínskýʼs engagement in co-optations as a revenge for the purges during normalisation. For instance, the dissident and later Czech Prime Minister Petr Pithart suggests that Jičínský “could not control himself” and repeatedly stated: “And now we shall do them what they did to us after August.”<span id="ojs-130-ftn32_return"><a class="notelink" title="For Pithartʼs statement see Petr Pithart, “Proměny politického systému v Československu na přelomu let 1989/1990” [Transformations of the Political Sy…" href="#ojs-130-ftn32"><sup>31</sup></a></span> The explanation does not stand firm within the context of Jičínskýʼs activities during the revolution and afterwards. The proposal for co-optations falls not only within his wider contribution to the post-Communist transformation of the parliament, but is also part of his own specific vision of post-November changes that differed radically from that of Havel. As the only one among revolutionary leaders, Zdeněk Jičínský was wholly prepared, as a professional and specialist, for his political role of the constitutional expert within the Civic Forum. His later right-wing opponents saw him chiefly as the author of the 1960 Constitution. Yet his activities in the November revolution benefitted far more from his experience in political negotiations about federalisation of Czechoslovakia in 1968. When drafting the bill on Czechoslovak federalisation that de facto represented a new Constitution, Jičínský tested the opportunities and limits of a compromise between the (Slovak) principle of sovereignty and the (Czech) civic principle of equality of votes. He also had an opportunity to test the narrow limits of Czech understanding of the Slovak issue. Finally, a year later, he experienced himself the “restructuring” of the parliament when forced to resign from both mandates and his seats were immediately filled by co-optation. Shortly prior to November, Zdeněk Jičínský, the author of many texts of Charter 77, together with other lawyers participated in developing an alternative draft of the Constitution that was to be the answer by the Opposition to the draft developed by the Government.<span id="ojs-130-ftn33_return"><a class="notelink" title="See ICH, COH, coll.

In November 1989, unlike many of his reform-minded Communist friends, he did not attempt to reform the Communist Party. Yet his political and ideological world was deeply marked by life experience of a reform Communist who fought the aesthetic-political project of the late Stalinism. That gave rise to his scepticism about revolutionary heroism, an emphasis on the “effect of time”, as much as his concern about excessive power of an individual – the cult of personality.<span id="ojs-130-ftn34_return"><a class="notelink" title="Cf.

To Jičínský, the reference to 1968 laid not as much in the continuity with certain political stream, as much in the continuity of a state sui iuris, a state that is free to run its affairs, particularly the issues related to the relationship between the Czechs and Slovaks. During the leadership negotiations at the Civic Forum Jičínský repeatedly proposed Alexander Dubček for Presidency.

He argued that, vis-à-vis the revolutionary avalanche, legality stood as the “cultural method of power” needed for the preservation of social cohesion. He was also mindful of preservation of the continuity of state. Here he was guided by his experience of state existence that could not be taken for granted. The continuity of state was based on a political accord between the two national representatives, expressed at the time in the act on Czechoslovak federation. The federalisation of 1968 was thus not “merely administratively complex a method of totalitarian governance”, as stated by Václav Havel at the Federal Assembly on 23 January 1990, but it was a manifestation of recognition of equality of the Slovak people.<span id="ojs-130-ftn42_return"><a class="notelink" title="“Projev ve Federálním shromáždění 23. ledna 1990” [Address to the Federal Assembly on January 23, 1990], in Spisy [Collected Works], vol. 6, ed.

Apart from the election of Václav Havel for Presidency which was a clear legitimisation of the mandates acquired in the 1986 “elections”, an additional factor was, paradoxically, the first wave of co-optations.

Non-partisan MPs were dismissed by the “relevant body” within the National Front upon agreement with the Civic Forum or the Public Against Violence. The very principle of co-optation required no further debate as it had already been legalised by the Constitutional Act of 28 December. Further agreement only concerned its extension to all other levels of representative assemblies. The Communist Party had, for some time, been making it clear that it had not insisted on retention of majority in the parliaments. Moreover, the act gave it an opportunity to regain, at least for the time being, control over its own, increasingly independent MPs.</p><p id="ojs-130-p-33"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>The draft bill on dismissals of MPs was first debated in committees. Those were the fora to which the MPs were accustomed to, even during the previous régime, to table critical objections or proposals for amendments. Similarly to the Communist era, the debate at the committees again largely supplemented the absent plenary debate. The formulation of the bill that enabled the dismissal of MPs who, “because of their hitherto activities do not offer guarantees for the development of political democracy” was the source of major indignation. For instance, an MP at the Committee for Industry, Transport and Trade stated that it was unclear “what is the measure to ascertain who does and who does not offer guarantees for democracy ...

Part of MPs criticised the fact that the bill eliminated the representative nature of the parliament. One of the MPs, a representative of the Slovak Union of Women, pointed out that not a single woman was among the 22 co-opted deputies for the Federal Assembly and that only a single woman was co-opted in place of the three female MPs that stepped down.

It sometimes even brought critical voices in the plenary, for instance on the issue of “triune constitution.” The co-optations thus meant reduction of authority of the supreme national institution. That was also the ground on which the Chairman of the Slovak National Council Rudolf Schuster objected to them. The co-optations, however, were in particular conflict with the self-definition of the Public Against Violence as a consistent opposition to the previous régime; hence it was unwilling to be “co-opted.” Whilst the largely Slovak doubts about co-optations did not meet significant response in public media discourse or at street demonstrations, it was at the federal parliament where the discordant voices could not be ignored.</p></div><div class="subchapter" id="ojs-130-articel-sub06"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.6. </span><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="ojs-130-head-11">The adoption of the bill on dismissal of MPs</span></h3><p id="ojs-130-p-37"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The first post-revolution session of the Federal Assembly on 29 November was broadcasted live at the Czechoslovak Television.

The position of the cameras did not allow to capture the key part of the plenary – the Slovak section of the House of Peoples, when the voting machine got stuck. On the contrary, it enabled to record whispering among the members of the presidium (Alexander Dubček: “Stanislav, what to do about it now?”<span id="ojs-130-ftn65_return"><a class="notelink" title="Alexander Dubček turned to the former Chairman of the Federal Assembly Stanislav Kukrál." href="#ojs-130-ftn65"><sup>64</sup></a></span>).

His was certainly the most impressive “counter-revolutionary” speech that the Communist conservatives dared.<span id="ojs-130-ftn67_return"><a class="notelink" title="Cf.

Yet we hear a voice from everywhere --- weʼve got to hurry, fast, fast, fast. Someone is worried about missing something ... One cannot make the laws in a hurry.” According to Riško, the Civic Forum followed the same script as did the Communist Party in 1969 and it was using the same, specifically Czechoslovak method devised to remove potential political opponents in the parliament.</p><p id="ojs-130-p-41"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>Riškoʼs speech triggered an hour-long unscheduled debate. The MPs were competing to dismiss the Communist MP. All agreed on that Ján Riško ought to be silent, for he was silent for twenty years. With the exception of a few co-opted MPs, the objection applied to all existing MPs none of whom could pride themselves in a daring speech to the plenary. Yet most of them believed that they secured their right to speak by having consented to the post-November developments. “The freedom to consent” was a right that the MPs earned by conformity, particularly with the election of the President. The “freedom of consent” thus perceived is similar to the understanding of freedom by the Communist Party.<span id="ojs-130-ftn69_return"><a class="notelink" title="Cf. Petr Fidelius, “Řeč komunistické moci” [“The Communist Power Talk”] (Praha: Triáda, 1998)." href="#ojs-130-ftn69"><sup>68</sup></a></span> Nevertheless, the Federal Assembly thus destined itself after November 1989 to its hitherto status: one of an institution that is clad into constitutional clothes of decisions adopted elsewhere. Even though parliaments, including those in democracies, often play the same role and the parliament of the first Czechoslovak Republic did largely the same, in this case even the right to debate was being denied. Apart from the main line of criticism of Riškoʼs speech, a number of additional side issues emerged. Zdeněk Jičínský, for instance, argued that the presented bill cannot be compared with the parliamentary purges of 1969, as other civil rights of MPs remain intact. Unlike in the case of the MPs dismissed in 1969, “no one will prevent Mr Riško to bid for his mandate in the free elections scheduled for June” Jičínský stated. He thus indicated that he was aware of Riškoʼs dismissal that had already been agreed, even though the bill had not yet been adopted. Paradoxically and from purely formal perspective, the dismissal of MPs in 1969 was “cleaner” as the right to dismiss was bestowed upon the parliaments, and not on political parties as was the case in 1990.</p><p id="ojs-130-p-42"><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>Another frequent theme in the criticism of Riškoʼs speech and in defence of the dismissal of MPs was a claim that the “reconstruction of the parliament” was a necessary step for “the political composition [of the parliament] to ideally reflect the political compositions and mentality of the people in our country.”<span id="ojs-130-ftn70_return"><a class="notelink" title="Address by Mr Stanislav Hanák, MP.

That is why elections are held after all.</p><p id="ojs-130-p-43"><span class="numberParagraph">7</span>After the debate Alexander Dubček, being evidently insecure, called the vote. The bill was passed smoothly in the House of Peoples, with only nine MPs abstaining. In the crucial House of Nations, however, nearly forty MPs were absent. Thus, whilst the Czech section passed the bill, albeit with a narrow margin, three MPs opposed it in the Slovak section (including Ján Riško), and 22 others abstained. Thus the bill was not adopted. Alexander Dubček, who chaired the session and the voting following the printed script, first declared the bill adopted. Only after vocal objections from the Slovak section, constantly apologising, he started to look for “legislators in the know” who would be able to resolve the situation in which the Federal Assembly found itself for the first time in its history. After a few intermissions and procedural discussions<span id="ojs-130-ftn71_return"><a class="notelink" title="See further Suk, Labyrintem revoluce, 289–290." href="#ojs-130-ftn71"><sup>70</sup></a></span> a Conciliation Committee was set up for the very first time, to be chaired by Zdeněk Jičínský. It was to find a way out of the conflict between the two Houses.</p><p id="ojs-130-p-44"><span class="numberParagraph">8</span>Prior to that, Václav Havel addressed the plenary of the Federal Assembly with nearly a two-hour long speech.<span id="ojs-130-ftn72_return"><a class="notelink" title="“Projev ve Federálním shromáždění 23. ledna 1990” [Address to the Federal Assembly on 23 January 1990], in Spisy [Collected Works], vol. 6, ed. Václav…" href="#ojs-130-ftn72"><sup>71</sup></a></span> It was his first opportunity to address the parliament as President. In particular, however, it was a chance to present his political-aesthetic plans in the dramatic juxtaposition to the prop of the Communist parliament and (mostly) Communist MPs. Havel informed the MPs, who were taken aback and whose faith was just being decided behind the scenes in the parliament, of the details of his intentions (about his request presented to Sweden to return a part of the trophies of the Thirty-Year War, about the “incredibly distasteful” bathrooms at the chateau Lány, or about the new uniforms of the Castle Guards). His notes were addressed to the television viewers rather than the MPs. In his address Havel did not forget to remind the MPs that “it was the old era that raised you to your posts”. He also very clearly suggested that he derived his authority from the revolution (“the public to which I feel utmost responsibility”), and not from the parliament. In conclusion, Havel famously proposed a change to the names of the three republics, their coats of arms, names of armies and suggested that he expected the parliament to promptly content to his proposals. The Federal Assembly postponed the debate on Havelʼs proposals – a decision which is often identified as the cause of the “hyphen war”.<span id="ojs-130-ftn73_return"><a class="notelink" title="The term “hyphen war” refers to a long and complex conflict about the name of the common state in the first half of 1990." href="#ojs-130-ftn73"><sup>72</sup></a></span> Co-optations were among the reasons why the debate was postponed. Because of the resignation of nearly one half of MPs “the short parliament” between its 22<sup itemprop="hi">nd</sup> and 23rd sessions (23 – 30 January) was unable to carry out even the essential procedural tasks. The presidium of the House of Peoples could not reach a quorum.</p><p id="ojs-130-p-45"><span class="numberParagraph">9</span>Shortly before 6pm, after the debate on a number of additional points, the Houses reconvened to debate the bill on dismissal of MPs. Zdeněk Jičínský reviewed the deliberations of the Conciliation Committee. He informed that the failure to adopt the bill was caused by the discontent of independent MPs with the formal procedure in debating the bill that was unrelated to the content of the draft bill. He then appealed to the Slovak MPs who first abstained, to assume a clear position either in support of or against the bill. No one abstained in the subsequent voting, with only a single MP voting against. The parliament did not yet have the voting equipment, what was explicable given the hitherto method of voting. It is therefore impossible to estimate the number of MPs voting for the bill. Television footage shows that some MPs, such as Ján Riško, did not vote at all. The smooth adoption of the bill in the second round of voting suggests that the Slovak MPs did not try to block the bill, but tried to firmly protest against the misuse of the parliament. They fought for the right of the parliament to consent (procedurally accurately), the right to being taken at least as seriously as was case of the Communist parliament and, eventually, for the right of MPs to consider their hitherto public activities meaningful. After the adoption of the bill on dismissal of the MPs the agenda of the 22<sup itemprop="hi">nd</sup> session was summarily debated. The televised broadcast from the Federal Assembly closed with an image of MPs from the House of People leaving the parliament forever, others who might return in a week to elect over hundred and thirty new colleagues. The sensitive microphones of the state Czechoslovak Television captured their mutual farewells.</p></div><div class="subchapter" id="ojs-130-articel-sub07"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.7. </span><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="ojs-130-head-12">Conclusion</span></h3><p id="ojs-130-p-46"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The co-optations significantly changed the status of the parliament in the post-November distribution of power. The institute of roundtable talks disintegrated and the parliament became the central (though not exclusive) platform for political negotiations. The aforementioned process of “self-parliamentarisation” has accelerated considerably, i.e. the emancipation of the legislature vis-à-vis the executive power. The “hyphen war” that broke out instantly after the co-optations was thus waged in the parliament, and not behind the political scenes or on the street. The side effect of the shift from roundtable talks to parliamentary debates resulted in a deep plunge in the influence of small political parties within the National Front: with their meek parliamentary fractions and mediocre electoral perspectives, they could not compete with the far more numerous and prospective parliamentary fractions of the Civic Forum and the Communist Party. Together with the outer position of the parliament within the structure of the power, the inner running of the Federal Assembly as an institution changed as well. Though the co-optations changed nearly a half of MPs, the key bodies of the Federal Assembly (the presidium, chairs of committees) experienced far deeper change. The two thirds of members of the presidium of the Federal Assembly have been changed; the presidiums of the Houses have been changed altogether, and the roles of the chairs of the committees have been changed by 85 percent.<span id="ojs-130-ftn74_return"><a class="notelink" title="Jana Reschová, “Nová politika s novými ľuďmi” [New Politics with New People], Sociologický časopis 28 (1992): 227." href="#ojs-130-ftn74"><sup>73</sup></a></span></p><p id="ojs-130-p-47"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>The speed of work at the parliament also rapidly increased as the legislature convened far more often than under communism and debated far greater number of bills. That is also related to yet another internal transformation – the development of the rules of procedure appropriate for a parliament that was no longer under the oversight of the Communist Party, but one that had to itself regulate its internal disagreements. Even though the new rules of procedure were only adopted in the subsequent parliamentary term, the change in debating the bills followed soon after the co-optations. The initiative presented by Vladimír Mikule proved particularly important. He achieved, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">inter alia</span>, that each amendment had to be first discussed in the Constitutional-Legal Committee prior to being voted on.<span id="ojs-130-ftn75_return"><a class="notelink" title="Jičínský, Československý parlament, 91–92." href="#ojs-130-ftn75"><sup>74</sup></a></span> Parliamentary mandate was no longer an occasional duty or status accessory, but full time job. That also raised the issue of wages for the MPs. Political culture has changed substantially. Instead of the perfect parliamentary machine of the Communist era with disciplined deputies, pre-approved input and careful choreographed sessions, the co-opted parliament was a picture of chaos, improvisation and procedural hurdles.</p><p id="ojs-130-p-48"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Co-optations have been a decisive step on the path of the Federal Assembly from the Communist parliament to the liberal one that only emerged after the elections in June 1990. It was still the first step, as the vital regional principle remained in place until the elections in June 1990 (i.e. the MPs represented their constituency). It was also because the Civic Forum was shaping itself as a representative body of all social strata without any significant differentiation of political currents. It was only the disintegration of the parliamentary fraction of the Civic Forum nearly a year later brought the process to completion. By giving political parties and movements an opportunity to choose new MPs, co-optations also contributed to the introduction of the proportional electoral system and created conditions for the emergence of strong party democracy.</p><p id="ojs-130-p-49"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>From the wider Central European perspective, the main consequences of the co-optations in the Federal Assembly were the institutionalisation and slowdown of the November revolution. The Velvet Revolution that proved unique in post-Communist Europe for its pace, turned into “refolution”,<span id="ojs-130-ftn76_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ash, We The People, 14." href="#ojs-130-ftn76"><sup>75</sup></a></span> a hybrid between revolution and reform. Co-optations, though a specifically Czechoslovak method, drew Czechoslovakia closer to other countries of Eastern Europe. They created a new political class and, at the same time, helped a number of “old structures” survive (if only for short time): the political parties within the National Front and some of its officials, the legal system of the Communist Czechoslovakia, the constitutional system of 1968, and thus the common state of the Czechs and Slovaks.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="small-6 columns text-center"><p><a class="button" href="ojs-130-abstract.html" title="Previous: Abstract">&lt;&lt;</a></p></div><div class="small-6 columns text-center"><p><a class="button" href="ojs-130-bibliogr.html" title="Next: Sources and references">&gt;&gt;</a></p></div></div><!--Notes in [div]--><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Notes</div><div class="note" id="ojs-130-ftn1"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ojs-130-ftn1_return"><sup>*</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">senior researcher, PhD, Institute of Contemporary History of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Puškinovo náměstí 9, Prague 6, 16000, Czech Republic, <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="mailto:roubal@usd.cas.cz">roubal@usd.cas.cz</a></span></p></div><div class="note" id="ojs-130-ftn2"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ojs-130-ftn2_return"><sup>1.</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">This text is an abridged and adapted version of the study Petr Roubal, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Starý pes, nové kousky: kooptace do Federálního shromáždění a vytváření polistopadové politické kultury</span> [Old Dog, New Tricks: Co-optations in the Federal Assembly and the Development of the Post-November Political Culture] (Prague: Ústav pro soudobé dějiny, 2013).</span></p></div><div class="note" id="ojs-130-ftn3"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ojs-130-ftn3_return"><sup>2.</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">Timothy Garton Ash, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">We The People: The Revolution of 89 Witnessed in Warsaw, Budapest, Berlin &amp; Prague</span> (London: Penguin Books, 1990), 89.</span></p></div><div class="note" id="ojs-130-ftn4"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ojs-130-ftn4_return"><sup>3.</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">Cf.

Later he hosted his own show, the Frank Zappa’s Wild Wild East. It seems that, for Zappa who unsuccessfully tried to do business with the Soviet Union, the visit to Czechoslovakia in January 1990 was essentially an attempt to establish business contacts. He thus had Václav Havel appoint him Special Ambassador to the West on Trade, Culture and Tourism. That led the US Secretary of State James Baker to state wryly: “You can do business with the United States or you can do business with Frank Zappa.” On the other side, to Václav Havel and other post-dissent politicians the encounter with the prominent figures of the Western alternative rock scene was a means to overcome the conflict between their own “authentic” past and the contemporary role within the political establishment and support to the neoliberal reforms.</span></p></div><div class="note" id="ojs-130-ftn67"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ojs-130-ftn67_return"><sup>66.</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">Cf.
