statehood. It has had its current borders since 1945, when it was constituted as a federal republic of the socialist Yugoslavia. Slovenia became independent at the same time as it transformed into a democracy: with the collapse of communism and disintegration of Yugoslavia in 1991. As the most developed of Yugoslav republics – with the most advanced economy, already well integrated in the West European markets, and ethnically the most homogenous of the former Yugoslav federal republics – the Slovenian transition to democracy was both smooth and quick. The process was only interrupted by a brief but intense war at the end of June 1991, resulting from the intervention of the federal army, which tried to prevent the inevitable process of the Yugoslav breakup.<span id="ojs-120-ftn3_return"><a class="notelink" title="Niko Toš and Vlado Miheljak, &#34;Transition in Slovenia: Towards Democratization and the Attainment of Sovereignty,&#34; in Slovenia Between continuity and c…" href="#ojs-120-ftn3"><sup>1</sup></a></span> Like in other post-socialist countries, political parties in Slovenia played a crucial role as proponents of change in the transition process from the former communist regime, which has been labelled as transplaced<span id="ojs-120-ftn4_return"><a class="notelink" title="Samuel P.

Some new parties emerged from the transformation of the League of Communists of Slovenia (in 1993 renamed as the United List of Social Democrats, and in 2005 as Social Democrats); the League of Socialist Youth (later the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia); the Socialist League of the Working People (later renamed as the Socialist Alliance); and the Social Democratic League (later renamed as the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia). Simultaneously the opposition to the old regime, emerging from the society, first called the Alliance of Intellectuals and later renamed as the Slovenian Democratic Alliance/Union, was established at the end of the 1980s. Since then it has served as a base for the foundation of a number of political parties. It included social groups with specific issues at heart, such as religious groups (Slovenian Christian Democrats; Christian Socialists), peasants (the Slovenian Peasant Party - People’s Party, later renamed as the Slovenian People’s Party), pensioners (the Democratic Party of Pensioners), regional parties (e.g. the Alliance of Haloze, Alliance for Primorska, Party of Slovenian Štajerska), and ethnic interests (e.g. the Alliance of Roma, Communita Italiana). Certain other contemporary issue‑oriented social movements of that period, such as the Greens of Slovenia, also evolved into parties.</p><p id="ojs-120-p-11"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Out of these parties, the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia, also known as the DEMOS coalition, was created through an agreement between the <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenian_Democratic_Union">Slovenian Democratic Union</a>, the <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenian_Democratic_Party">Social Democrat Alliance of Slovenia</a>, the <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_Christian_Democrats">Slovene Christian Democrats</a>, the <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenian_People%27s_Party">Peasant Alliance</a> and the <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greens_of_Slovenia">Greens of Slovenia</a>. In 1992 the Slovenian Democratic Union split into two parties: the social-liberal wing became the <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(Slovenia)">Democratic Party</a>, and the <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism">conservative</a> faction established the <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Party_(Slovenia)">National Democratic Party</a>. A third group, dissatisfied with both options, joined the Social Democratic Party (SDSS, later simplified to SDS), which suffered a clear defeat at the 1992 elections, barely securing its entry in the <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenian_National_Assembly">Parliament</a>. Nevertheless, it formed a coalition with the winning <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democracy_of_Slovenia">Liberal Democracy of Slovenia</a> and even became a member of the governing coalition. Later it became the dominant party of the right of center under the name of Slovenian Democratic Party.</p><p id="ojs-120-p-12"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Only those socio-political organisations from the old regime that successfully transformed themselves, as well as new formations which managed to establish clear political identities and organisations, were able to survive the transition processes and constitute the new democratic party system. The successful parties generally managed to create a widespread organisation in the field, while at the same time maintaining a strong central party organisation and a high degree of party unity – all of this despite the lack of politically experienced members and with only limited financial resources. All other parties, including those with strong international support, vanished from the public life almost overnight.<span id="ojs-120-ftn9_return"><a class="notelink" title="Fink-Hafner, &#34;Between continuity and change,&#34; 48." href="#ojs-120-ftn9"><sup>7</sup></a></span></p><p id="ojs-120-p-13"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>In its first two decades, the party system of Slovenia was characterised by the relative openness, allowing for a relatively easy entry of new parties. However, at the same time it exhibited a high degree of party stability, with parties creating stable organisations, membership bases and political identities. At the level of interparty competition, the party system was initially characterised by the dominance of Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (LDS). This was followed by the increasing bipolarity, with one end dominated initially by the LDS and then a succession of three other, often new parties; while the other end has become increasingly dominated by the Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS).<span id="ojs-120-ftn10_return"><a class="notelink" title="For more information about the characteristics of the Slovenian political parties since 1990 see Danica Fink-Hafner, &#34;Strankarski sistem v Sloveniji: …" href="#ojs-120-ftn10"><sup>8</sup></a></span></p><p id="ojs-120-p-14"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>Despite the relative openness of the Slovenian party system, only a small number of new parties entered the Slovenian Parliament in the first two decades. This trend started to change at the 2008 parliamentary elections, with the rapid decline of the LDS, strengthening of the SD as the temporary strongest party on the left, and the entry of a new party splintering from the LDS into the Parliament (Zares). At the 2011 and 2014 elections the instability of party systems reached new heights, with the once dominant LDS almost completely disappearing from the scene, being supplanted on the broad left first by the SD, then by the Positive Slovenia, and finally by the Miro Cerar's Party, later renamed as the Modern Centre Party. This opened a new trend of single-term parties, emerging and disappearing from one election to the next, leading to a huge turnover in the Parliament. Despite the increasing instability, no anti-system parties have emerged in Slovenia, although some parties have occasionally challenged the legitimacy of the ruling political elite and called for its replacement at early elections.<span id="ojs-120-ftn11_return"><a class="notelink" title="Jure Gašparič, Državni zbor 1992-2012: o slovenskem parlamentarizmu (Ljubljana: Inštitut za novejšo zgodovino, 2012).

For the most part, Slovenian parties aim to be "catch-all" organisations, as their programmes and appeals address a wide range of voters with varying concerns. This is also true in case of the rare parliamentary “interest-group parties” such as the DESUS. However, for the most of the time since multiparty democracy was established, the principal political parties did possess a clear political identity and identifiable, if not always permanently loyal, electoral base. Additionally, we should also note that in the past the parties which have shown a narrower focus on the specific issues and policies were not electorally successful in the long term, and the Green parties in the nineties are a typical example of this.</p></div><div class="subchapter" id="ojs-120-articel-sub02"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.2. </span><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="ojs-120-head-7">Legal and Financial Frameworks for a Transparent Functioning of Political Parties in Slovenia</span></h3><p id="ojs-120-p-16"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>In accordance with the Political Parties Act, a political party in Slovenia is defined as "<span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">an association of citizens who pursue their political goals as adopted in the party's programme through the democratic formulation of the political will of the citizens and by proposing candidates for elections to the National Assembly, elections for the president of the republic and for elections to local community bodies</span>."<span id="ojs-120-ftn13_return"><a class="notelink" title="&#34;Political Party Act.

Parties that propose candidates for the elections to the National Assembly have the right to receive funds from the national budget, provided that they received at least 1 percent (or 1.2 % if two parties compete on a joint list; or 1.5 % if three or more compete together on one list) of votes nationwide. The amount of the public funds available to the political parties depends on the electoral result. It should also be noted that the political parties which are represented in the National Assembly are entitled to other "indirect" (financial, personnel, administrative) resources, which they receive from the National Assembly budget. It should be noted that although a 4-percent threshold is set at the national level as the level of eligibility for the reception of public funds, there are also some non-parliamentary parties – those which received more than one percent or less than four percent of the votes of voters at the national level – which are also entitled to public funding. In light of all of the above, in practice this means that Slovenian parliamentary parties receive a substantial portion of their resources from the budget (national and municipal), and only a moderate amount from membership fees and donations.</p><p id="ojs-120-p-19"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>However the issues with regard to the integrity of political parties, especially with regard to the transparency of party membership and funding, as well as issues related to the assurance of effective control over funding have been on the agenda almost constantly ever since the Slovenian independence.

Table 1 shows that the number of parties competing at the elections ranged from 17 to 23, reaching 26 only in 1992, after the departure of the DEMOS coalition from the political scene resulted in a large number of new parties contesting the elections.

Complete changes of governing parties were almost completely absent from the Slovenian party system, while innovations of the governmental formula mostly came about as the consequence of the emergence of new parties. In fact, the largest source of instability and volatility in the Slovenian party system has been the disappearance of old and emergence of new parties.

The elections of 2011 and 2014 were also different because a few parliamentary parties existing from 1992 – two of them playing an important part in all the governments between 1992 and 2011 – failed to enter the Parliament. In 2011 the LDS and the only nationalistic party, the SNS, lost parliamentary representation, while in 2014 the oldest Slovenian political party, the Slovenian Peoples Party (SLS), failed to win any seats. These went to the winner of the 2011 elections Positive Slovenia (PS) as well as the newly established Citizens List (DLGV), which was the third biggest parliamentary party in the 2011–2014 term.</p><div class="table-scroll hover" itemprop="table" id="ojs-120-table-1"><table><caption><b>Table 1: </b>Data regarding the number of parties in the parliamentary elections in Slovenia, 1990-2014</caption><tr itemprop="row"><td></td><th>1990</th><th>1992</th><th>1996</th><th>2000</th><th>2004</th><th>2008</th><th>2011</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr itemprop="row"><th>No. of candidates</th><td>851</td><td>1475</td><td>1300</td><td>1007</td><td>1395</td><td>1182</td><td>1300</td><td>na</td></tr><tr itemprop="row"><th>No. of competing parties</th><td>17</td><td>26</td><td>22</td><td>23</td><td>23</td><td>17</td><td>20</td><td>17</td></tr><tr itemprop="row"><th>No. of elected parties</th><td>9</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>7</td></tr><tr itemprop="row"><th>No. of newely elected parties</th><td>/</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2/3*</td></tr><tr itemprop="row"><th>No. of unelected parties</th><td>/</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2/3**</td></tr><tr itemprop="row"><th>No. of coalition parties</th><td>Demos, 5, later 6</td><td>4, later 3 and then 2</td><td>3 dropping to 2 </td><td>5 dropping to 4 </td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>5 droping to 4</td><td>3</td></tr></table><span class="note" itemprop="note" id="Note24"><span class="noteLabel">*</span>Counting the ZaAB as a new party, not as one of the successors to the PS<br itemprop="lb" /></span><span class="note" itemprop="note" id="Note25"><span class="noteLabel">**</span>Not counting the ZaAB as one of the successors to the PS<br itemprop="lb" /></span><span class="note" itemprop="note" id="Note26"><span class="noteLabel"></span>Source: National Electoral Commission (2015).<br itemprop="lb" /></span></div><p id="ojs-120-p-27"><span class="numberParagraph">7</span>Despite the frequent creation of new parties and elimination of existing parties, the Slovenian party system has been characterised by a relative stability. In the first decade of democratic politics, the Slovenian political arena was dominated by the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (LDS), which controlled the government for 12 years after 1992 through coalitions that included left and right-wing parties alike. With the strengthening of the SDS, more clearly defined bloc alternatives emerged, and the last four elections were characterised by a bipolar pattern of competition between the SDS and a strong left-wing party: first the LDS, then the SD, PS, and now the Party of Modern Centre (SMC).</p><p id="ojs-120-p-28"><span class="numberParagraph">8</span>So far the most important changes in the structure of the party system the last two elections, affecting predominantly the formerly dominant left and centre-left parties. In 2011 the LDS received slightly less than 2 % of votes, while its splinter party Zares, formed for the 2008 elections, also failed to enter the Parliament. The elimination of the only nationalist party, Slovene National Party (SNS), which had been a member of the Parliament since 1992, was significant as well. In 2011 the newly-established parties – the PS (centre-left) and the DLGV (centre-right)<span id="ojs-120-ftn24_return"><a class="notelink" title="Simona Kustec Lipicer and Niko Toš, &#34;Analiza volilnega vedenja in izbir na prvih predčasnih volitvah v državni zbor,&#34; Teorija in praksa 50, no. 3/4 (2…" href="#ojs-120-ftn24"><sup>22</sup></a></span> – gained seats and participated in the government, together receiving more than 37 percent of the votes. These parties soon dropped out of the Parliament in the 2014 elections, when they gained less than 4 percent of the votes in total. At the 2014 elections two new parties entered parliament: the Party of Miro Cerar, now renamed as the Modern Centre Party (SMC), and the United Left (ZL), together won more than 40 percent of the votes, while the 2011–2014 term parliamentary parties – the PS, DLGV and SLS – dropped out of the Parliament.</p><p id="ojs-120-p-29"><span class="numberParagraph">9</span>When we shift our focus from the number of parties to the movement of voters, we can observe that the level of volatility at the Slovenian elections, as shown in <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="ojs-120-article.html#figure1" title="Volatility and vote share of new parties in the parliamentary elections in Slovenia 19922014Source own calculations on the basi...">Figure 1</a>, remained comparatively high after the first elections (above 30 percent). However, in 2004 it dropped to 23 percent as a stronger bipolar pattern of party competition emerged. Since the 2008 elections volatility has been increasing again, topping 50 percent in 2014 and indicating a heightened instability of the party system as well as the weakening of links between the parties and voters and an increased willingness of voters to switch support between parties or move on to supporting an entirely new political party.</p><figure class="figure" itemprop="figure" id="figure1"><figcaption class="caption" itemprop="head"><b>Figure 1: </b>Volatility and vote share of new parties in the parliamentary elections in Slovenia 1992-2014</figcaption><img src="PNZ-ojs-120-figure1.jpg" alt="Volatility and vote share of new parties in the&#xA;                            parliamentary elections in Slovenia 1992-2014" class="graphic" itemprop="graphic" /><p id="index-p-d41e660"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>Source: own calculations on the basis of the data provided by the National Electoral Commission (2015)</p></figure><p id="ojs-120-p-31"><span class="numberParagraph">10</span>If we analyse the share of votes for the new parties at each elections we get a somewhat better picture of what drives such high level of volatility over time.

Still, while volatility has been fairly high from the beginning, we can see that the vote share of the new parties was relatively modest until the 2008 elections, suggesting that volatility was mostly driven by the shifts of the electorate within the established parties. However, at last two elections the share of votes belonging to new parties has been on the rise precipitously, and this accounts for most of the volatility taking place in the Slovenian elections.</p><p id="ojs-120-p-32"><span class="numberParagraph">11</span>When we look at the number of votes of the relevant parties in the period between 1992 and 2014, we see that the changes in the amount of party support were considerable, not only as far as the share of votes parties gained is concerned, but also with regard to the actual number of votes parties won at elections. What clearly comes across as the starkest finding is that with the end of the LDS dominance on the political scene, the voters supporting the broad left side of the political spectrum have shifted their support from the LDS to the SD, then to the PS, and finally to the SMC. On the right side, after the SLS lost the position of the second party in the party system at the 2000 elections, this consolidation took place primarily around the SDS in the second decade of democratic politics. The SDS managed to win the support of almost a third of the electorate between 2004 and 2011, only to witness the demobilization of about one third of its voters at the 2014 elections while still retaining the status of the second largest party in the context of the significantly reduced turnout. </p><p id="ojs-120-p-33"><span class="numberParagraph">12</span>The seats in the National Assembly over time and in particular since 2000, are increasingly becoming distributed in such a way as to make a clear distinction between the smaller and larger parties in the context of an increasing bipolarity.

Since the establishment of the party system we have been able to observe that the share of voters who voted for parties represented in the Parliament, or, in other words, the share of voters whose votes are represented, increased just after the first elections. However, since then this share has remained between 84 percent and 93 percent within the period. The lowest share of represented voters (76 percent) can be traced back to the first elections in 1992, which are also the elections with the highest number of parties competing, while the best representation was achieved in 2000, when less than 10 percent of voters voted for parties that did not manage to enter the Parliament. The fact that despite the significant instability of the party system in the last decade 85 % of voters voted for parties that are represented in the Parliament is perhaps related to this very party system instability. As it happens, in the eyes of the voters such instability implies a reasonable probability that switching support to a different party will not result in a wasted vote. Furthermore, it also signifies that a large number of parties does not lead to a large number of wasted votes, or to a continued concentration of support for marginal parties. </p><figure class="figure" itemprop="figure" id="figure4"><figcaption class="caption" itemprop="head"><b>Figure 4: </b>Share of voters voting for parties represented in the Parliament</figcaption><img src="PNZ-ojs-120-figure4.jpg" alt="Share of voters voting for parties represented in the&#xA;                            Parliament" class="graphic" itemprop="graphic" /><p id="index-p-d41e689"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>Source: National Electoral Commission (2014).</p></figure><p id="ojs-120-p-38"><span class="numberParagraph">14</span>In conclusion, when we observe the development of the Slovenian electoral and parliamentary party system, we can pinpoint several significant developments affecting the stability of the party system and changing the way it has functioned after the first decade of democracy:</p><ol class="ordered" itemprop="list" id="ojs-120-list-1"><li class="item" itemprop="item" id="d41e694">As a result of the 2004 elections, the first centre-right government, led by the SDS, was formed after the twelve-year dominance of the centre-left coalition government of LDS, leading to a more pronounced bipolarisation of the party system.</li><li class="item" itemprop="item" id="d41e696">In 2008 the centre-right government lost the elections.

The term of this government was characterised by the beginning of the economic slowdown and modest growth as well as increasing financial problems in the banking sector, as well as conflicts within the government.

This may point to the conclusion that the electoral upheaval, affecting Slovenian politics at the 2011 and 2014 elections, was not so much about the voters trying to find a new political direction, but rather that it was a case of the voters being dissatisfied with the old political elites, therefore trying to replace them with a new set of actors without asking for credentials or assurances that the new elites in fact have any new solutions to the problems.</p></div><div class="subchapter" id="ojs-120-articel-sub06"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.6. </span><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="ojs-120-head-20">Final remarks</span></h3><p id="ojs-120-p-53"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The Slovenian party system as an integral element of parliamentary democracy since the Slovenian transition to democracy has exhibited several significant trends. On one hand the party system has exhibited a significant degree of stability in its aggregate characteristics. The number of parties competing at elections as well as the number of elected and governing parties, the broad contours of party programmes, and the patterns of governmental alterations have remained broadly stable over time.</p><p id="ojs-120-p-54"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>At the same time, while the party system has exhibited a significant degree of stability at the aggregate level, over time the instability at the level of political parties has increased. This has taken place in the context of the increased dissatisfaction of the citizens with the political parties. Electoral volatility, always high, further increased dramatically at the 2011 and 2014 elections, when the old parties were eliminated from the government from one election to the next and the share of votes for new parties reached 40 % or more. Increased volatility is just one of the trends indicating the increasingly critical attitude of citizens towards the parties and political institutions most closely related to the political parties, such as the government and the Parliament. It remains to be seen whether such a critical attitude of citizens towards the political parties will continue in the next electoral cycle. However, it is evident from the developments in the last few years that the new parties have a number of weaknesses and lack the resilience that the old parties have in terms of stable links with voters, stable party organisations allowing for steady and effective patterns of political recruitment, and stable party identity. The new parties that emerged in the 2014 elections are vulnerable the same as were their predecessors in 2011, and it is not unlikely that the degree of instability will persist, though the external pressure on the party system might decline if the economic conditions and modes of transparent governance are stabilised.</p><p id="ojs-120-p-55"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Finally, the party system is an essential element of the parliamentary system. Parties are the principal conduit for the recruitment of political elites and representation of the political preferences of voters. It is therefore not unlikely that the changes in the party system could ultimately lead to changes in the parliamentary arena.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="small-6 columns text-center"><p><a class="button" href="ojs-120-abstract.html" title="Previous: Abstract">&lt;&lt;</a></p></div><div class="small-6 columns text-center"><p><a class="button" href="ojs-120-bibliogr.html" title="Next: Sources and references">&gt;&gt;</a></p></div></div><!--Notes in [div]--><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Notes</div><div class="note" id="ojs-120-ftn1"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ojs-120-ftn1_return"><sup>*</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">Associate Professor and researcher, PhD, Faculty of Social sciences, University of Ljubljana, Kardeljeva pl. 5, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia, <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="mailto:simona.kustec-lipicer@fdv.uni-lj.si">simona.kustec-lipicer@fdv.uni-lj.si</a></span></p></div><div class="note" id="ojs-120-ftn2"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ojs-120-ftn2_return"><sup>**</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">Assistant Professor, PhD, Faculty of Political Sciences, University of Zagreb, Lepušićeva ul. 6, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="mailto:ahenjak@fpzg.hr">ahenjak@fpzg.hr</a></span></p></div><div class="note" id="ojs-120-ftn3"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ojs-120-ftn3_return"><sup>1.</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">Niko Toš and Vlado Miheljak, "Transition in Slovenia: Towards Democratization and the Attainment of Sovereignty," in <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Slovenia Between continuity and change 1990–1997</span>, ed.
